<h2 class="fs150"><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">INTRODUCTION</a></h2>


<p>In this volume I give a brief, popular account of
some of my work in Psychopathology, or Abnormal
Psychology for the last quarter of a century. I do
not refer to my work on psychopathic reflexes, moment-consciousness,
moment-thresholds, multiple personality
and other subjects. The reader will find
all these subjects in my other works. In this volume
I make an attempt to simplify matters. I lay stress
on the main factors and principles of that part of
Abnormal Psychology that deals with the subject of
nervous ills.</p>

<p>It is to be regretted that some physicians, and
among them many neurologists of excellent standing,
hesitate to accept the work accomplished in the domain
of Psychopathology, confusing the latter with
what parades at present under the name of psychoanalysis.
Thus a well known physician writes to me:</p>

<p>“I think that the majority of men in general work
(medical) do not separate Psychopathology from
Psychoanalysis. Freud’s theories and the whole
trend of psychoanalysis have been so turned into
channels of distorted and perverted sexual life that
it has blinded people to the fact that there are many
dominant phases in mental life which are not sexual.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
The ordinary, healthy minded, and vigorous practitioner
sees a lot of motives in life that are not sexual,
and where everything is twisted and turned to one
side, to one ‘complex,’ he becomes indignant and disgusted,
and condemns the whole broad subject of
Psychopathology.” I think that the physician is
right in his attitude.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact psychoanalysis, by which
Freud and his adherents have baptized their sexual
theories and metaphysical wish-speculations, should
be regarded as savage and barbaric. Psychoanalysis
is a sort of Astrology, full of superstitious
symbolizations, dream vagaries, and idle interpretations,
foisted on the credulous, on those obsessed by
sexual inclinations, and on those suffering from
sexual perversions. It is idle and credulous to
search in adults for “unconscious” memories of
babies a few months old. Many take up psychoanalysis
as a sort of mental masturbation which in
the long run is sure to play havoc with their nerve
and mind.</p>

<p>Psychoanalysis excites the curiosity of the vulgar
just as for thousands of years Astrology held the
interest of semi-civilized nations to the detriment of
the science of Astronomy. Psychoanalysis belongs
to the class of dangerous superstitions, harmful to
health, both social and individual. Psychoanalysis,
like Palmistry or Oneiroscopy, that is, “interpretation
of dreams,” imposes on the uncritical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
sense of the credulous public. Freudian psychoanalysis
should be openly declared as a fraud.</p>

<p>Lecky points out that superstitions are not destroyed
by discussion. To start a discussion in an
earnest way a common ground is required. What
common ground is there between science and superstition?
Superstition should be left alone to die of
inanition. There is no common ground between
psychoanalysis and psychopathology. That is why
it is just as impossible to argue with a psychoanalyst
as with a Mormon or a Mohammedan. Anyone who
does not accept the dogmas and superstitions of
psychoanalysis is accused of “resistance of hidden
complexes,” just as pious believers accuse sceptics of
evil thoughts.</p>

<p>A famous professor of a well known eastern college
asked me to continue my “good work” against
psychoanalysis. But criticism of psychoanalysis is
a thankless task. It is futile to discuss psychological
and medical matters with psychoanalysts. For psychoanalysts
care for nothing else but the fulfillment
of sexual wishes. It is useless to argue with psychoanalysts,
who as a rule possess no more critical sense
than Mormon saints. Psychoanalysis is a sort of
Mormonism. In the far West psychoanalysis is
preached from the pulpits in churches. Psychoanalysis
is a sex religion. One should combat it with ridicule
and scorn. Psychoanalysis needs a Voltaire, a
Molière, or a Swift.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>The so-called present civilized humanity, and especially
our populace, lives in an age of vulgarity.
Success <em>per se</em> is the sole aim in life. Books by the
thousands tell how to achieve “success,” how to
fool the nerves, or how to deceive the mind. “Efficiency”
and “success” fill home and school with all
sorts of lucubrations and advertisements. Mental
tests are supposed to help to success. Business success
is the slogan. And success is only to the mediocre
and the vulgar. Mediocrity writes for mediocrity,
and is applauded by mobs of mediocrity. To
teach the truth is a great privilege, but to deceive
the ignorant and to debauch the young and inexperienced
is a serious offence.</p>

<p>When science, literature, and art sink to the movie
stage, why wonder at their triviality? When Government
experts take seriously Freudian “Sublimation,”
why blame the credulity of the layman? When the
Bureau of Education spreads far and wide pamphlets
on mental tests, why wonder at the gullibility of the
populace?</p>

<p>The tendency towards the rule of mediocrity in
the twentieth century was observed by Tolstoy:</p>

<p>“About twenty years ago Matthew Arnold wrote
a beautiful article on the purpose of criticism. According
to his opinion, it is the purpose of criticism
to find what is most important and good in any book
whatever, wherever, and whenever written, and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
direct the reader’s attention to what is important
and good in them.</p>

<p>“Such a criticism seems to me indispensable in our
time of newspapers, periodicals, books, and advertisements.
Such a criticism is requisite for the future
of the cultured world.</p>

<p>“<em>Printing has for some time served as the chief
instrument for the diffusion of ignorance among the
well-to-do</em> (the middle classes, especially the so-called
new women).</p>

<p>“Books, periodicals, especially the newspapers,
have in our time become great financial undertakings
for the success of which the largest possible number
of purchasers is needed. The interests and tastes,
however, of the largest possible number of purchasers
are always low and vulgar. For the success of the
press it is necessary that the productions should
respond to the demands of the great majority of the
purchasers, that is, that they should touch upon the
low interests and correspond to the vulgar tastes.
The press fully satisfies these demands, which it is
quite able to do, since among the number of workers
for the press there are many more people with the
same low interests and vulgar tastes as the public
than men with high interests and refined taste.</p>

<p>“The worst thing about it is that the reading of
poor works corrupts the understanding and taste.
Good works can no longer be appreciated.</p>

<p>“In proportion as newspapers, periodicals, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
books become more and more disseminated, the value
of what is printed falls lower and lower, and the class
of the so-called cultured public sinks more and more
into a most hopeless, self-contented, incorrigible ignorance....</p>

<p>“A striking example is that of the English prose
writers. From the great Dickens we descend at first
to George Eliot, then to Thackeray, to Trollope;
and then begins the indifferent manufacture of a
Rider Haggard, Kipling, Hall Caine, and so forth.</p>

<p>“Still more striking is this fall noticed in American
literature. After the great galaxy, Emerson,
Thoreau, Lowell, Whittier, and others, everything
breaks off suddenly, and there appear beautiful editions
with beautiful illustrations and with beautiful
stories and novels which are impossible to read on
account of absence of all meaning.</p>

<p>“The ignorance of the cultured crowd of our times
has reached such a pass that great thinkers and
writers of former times no longer satisfy the highly
refined demands of new men (and new women).</p>

<p>“The last word of philosophy is the immoral,
coarse, inflated, disconnected babbling of Nietzsche.
Senseless, artificial conglomeration of words of decadent
poems is regarded as poetry of the highest
rank. The theatres give dramas, the meaning of
which is not known to any one, not even to the
author.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>What would Tolstoy have said had he witnessed
the full blown art of our movies?</p>

<p>What the movies and literature accomplish in the
world of art and letters, that is what psychoanalysis
and mental tests achieve in normal and abnormal
psychology.</p>

<p>The mediocrity of the modern man is akin to the
vulgarity of the ancient freedman, so well described
by Petronius in his type of Trimalchio. Both, the
greedy freedman and the “efficient” freeman, have
the same deleterious influence on the course of civilization.</p>

<p>Our age is not the age of Democracy, but of
Mediocrity. It is in such an age that sensationalism,
movies, and psychoanalysis are apt to flourish
like green bay trees.</p>

<p>The reader will find that I often turn to Social
Psychology. This is requisite. As I carry on my
work on nervous ills I become more and more convinced
that a knowledge of Social Psychology is essential
to a clear comprehension of nervous ills.</p>

<p>The number of cases given in the volume will, I am
sure, be of great help to the reader. For the concrete
cases, carefully studied by me, bring out distinctly
the mechanism, the factors, and the main
principles of nervous ills.</p>

<p>I address this volume to the reader who wishes to
learn the truth, not to those who are in search for
ever new amusements, or for the “best seller” of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
year. I hope that this work will prove of value to
the thoughtful physician and of interest to the cultured
layman.</p>

<p>I further hope that my reader will not be offended
by my statements about superstitions. <em>I address
myself to the liberal-minded reader who does not care
to follow the herd.</em></p>

<br />
SELF-PRESERVATION AND FEAR</h2>


<p>The impulse of self-preservation is at the basis
of all animal life. From the simplest lump of protoplasm
constituting a microbe to the highest form
of life, such as man, one meets with the same
primitive life tendency,&mdash;the impulse of self-preservation.
Throughout all animal creation one important
purpose runs, and that is the preservation
of life.</p>

<p>When a creature is launched into the world, it is
animated with one central, innate mission,&mdash;to live;
and to fight for its living. For this purpose,&mdash;if
purpose it really be, the creature, however small
and insignificant, is provided with a rich arsenal
of armour for defense and attack. When a biologist
demonstrated the anatomical structure of a
caterpillar, a bystander exclaimed in surprise:
“Why, I always thought that a caterpillar was
nothing but skin and squash!”</p>

<p>The simple living creatures, swarming in the waters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
of stagnant ponds and murky pools, the bits
of living matter, inhabiting by the million the little
world of a hanging drop of water, are supplied with
the most complicated reactions, mechanical and more
especially chemical, for the maintenance of their
life existence. Simple as a cell, a minute particle
of protoplasm, may appear, it is none the less a
most wonderful laboratory where toxins, anti-toxins,
and an infinite variety of secretions, highly poisonous
and protective, are being produced, for the
keeping in existence of that insignificant, microscopic
bit of living matter. <em>Self-preservation is the
central aim of all life-activities.</em></p>

<p>The tendency of all organic processes is the maintenance
of the life of each particular individual
organism. It is this aspect that I wish to impress
on the minds of my readers. Self-preservation is
the nucleus of organic life. It is the mainspring of
organic activities and functions. <em>The tendency of
life is not the preservation of the species, but solely
the preservation of each individual organism, as
long as it is in existence at all, and is able to carry
on its life processes.</em></p>

<p>Every living thing, from the ultra-microscopic to
the highest and most complex multicellular organism,
man included, has only one fundamental tendency,
the maintenance and defense of its <em>individual</em> existence.
The claim that the individual counts for
little or nothing, and that the species is everything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
is not true to facts. “Nature cares not for the
individual, but for the species” is a glittering generality
of a metaphysical character.</p>

<p>It is the maintenance of its individual existence
and the <em>struggle for this individuality</em> and its preservation,
whether in defense or aggression, that form
the main object of organic life in all its aspects.
<em>The aim of life activities is the individual, the species
is a secondary matter.</em> It is only when we keep
this fundamental truth in mind that we begin to
understand life in general, and human life in particular.</p>

<p>The struggle for existence of which so much is
heard in modern science, theoretical or applied,
means really the preservation of the individual
organism, or the self-preservation of individuality.
We may say that the <em>struggle for existence in the
biological and social worlds means nothing else but
the Struggle for Individuality</em>.</p>

<p>Wherever the organism forms a whole as to its
vitality, whether it be an amoeba or a man, the
struggle is for the maintenance of that whole or of
that particular individual organism. All the structures
and functions go to the preservation of that
individuality, or of that individual organic self,
constituting the impulse of self-preservation in
the total activity of the particular individual
organism. The great number of physico-chemical
and mechanical processes, adaptations and adjustments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
of inner structures and functions, as well as
the different reactions to the stimuli of external
environment, even in the lowest of micro-organisms,
are for the <em>whole</em> of the individuality.</p>

<p>When organisms take to forms of social life the
fundamental aim is still the protection or self-preservation
of the individual. The community is
an additional defense of the individual against a
hostile environment. Thus the herds of Damara
cattle, or of social aggregates of other animals,
offer greater protection to each individual animal.
The individual wolf running in packs has more
power for attack and defense. The individual man
has more forces for aggression and for protection
by living in a social medium which provides the
individual with more sensory organs for observation
of danger and with more organs for defense and
attack, than in isolated states. The herd, the pack,
the horde, the society are for the self-preservation
of the individual.</p>

<p>It has been shown on good grounds that the very
sense of external reality has become intensified in
the individual by his capacity of living in a social
aggregate. The social aggregate strengthens each
individual member of the group. The individual is
not for the group, but the group is for self-preservation
of the individual. Should the individual lose
his self-protection, or even have his impulse of
self-preservation lowered, the whole aggregate faces<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
ultimate destruction. That is why when in a social
aggregate the impulse of self-preservation becomes
limited, inhibited, and lowered by tyranny of social
commandments, society is sure to decline, degenerate,
and finally dissolve; or fall a victim to an
external invader,&mdash;the fate of tribes, communities,
and nations in the past and the present. <em>The moving
power of life is self-preservation of the individual.</em></p>

<p>A close study of life in general and of animal life
in particular brings one to the inevitable conclusion
that life in all its forms has self-preservation as
its fundamental principle. <em>Self-preservation is the
main impulse, the prime mover of life.</em> The prime
mover of life is not the impulse of species preservation,
or of sex, but the impulse of self-preservation
of the individual organism.</p>

<p>Self-preservation has two aspects, the positive
and the negative. In the positive form the primitive
impulse is to keep the individual alive, to keep the
functions and structure in normal condition, to conduce
to the full development and harmonious activity
of the individual. The negative form of the preservative
impulse is the preservation from injury, degeneration,
destruction, and death. This negative
aspect of the impulse of self-preservation expresses
itself in the higher animals in the form of fear.</p>

<p>The fear instinct is an essential constituent of the
impulse of life. We may call the fear instinct the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
guardian of all sentient being. Wherever there is
the least scent or even the least suggestion of danger,
there the instinct of fear is aroused. Fear is
the companion following close on the heels of the
impulse of self-preservation.</p>

<p>Since every animal is always surrounded by enemies,
and since every strange thing or strange occurrence
is a menace or possible signal of danger,
the fear instinct is aroused on all strange occasions.
The fear instinct requires the slightest stimulus
to start into function.</p>

<p>While most of the instincts require special conditions,
and are usually <em>periodic</em>, the fear instinct is
<em>ever present</em> and can be awakened on all occasions,
and under any circumstances. Anything unfamiliar,&mdash;darkness,
a state of exhaustion, weakness, fatigue,
arouses the fear instinct, startling the animal into
running, hiding, crouching, and preparation for
attack or defense.</p>

<p>The fear instinct stays with us, and watches over
us day and night. It follows us closely in our
active, waking life, attends us in our resting hours,
and watches over us in our sleeping periods. The
fear instinct is the last to fall asleep, and the first
to awake. The fear instinct follows us like our
shadow, with the only difference that it constantly
affects our actions, hardly ever leaves us alone, and
keeps steady vigilance over our life activities. The
reason for this apparently strange companionship<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
is the fact that the fear instinct is the primitive
instinct of the life impulse, the impulse for self-preservation.</p>

<p>The overwhelming intensity of the fundamental
impulse of self-preservation is well described by the
great writer Dostoevsky, whose insight into the
psychology of human life and especially into abnormal
mental life transcends that of any other writer:
“Where is it I have read that someone condemned
to death says or thinks, an hour before his death,
that if he had to live on some high rock, on such a
narrow ledge that he had only room to stand, and
the ocean, everlasting darkness, everlasting solitude,
everlasting tempest around him, if he had to remain
standing on a square yard of space all his life, a
thousand years, eternity, it were better to live so
than to die at once! Only to live, to live, and live!
Life whatever it may be!”</p>

<p>Just as the touch and pain nerves enmesh closely
our body, warning us against hurtful stimulations,
so we may say that fear, through our distant receptors
of sight, hearing and smell, surrounds us, warning
us against enemies, or inimical, suspicious objects,
and forces. Were it not for the fear instinct,
directly awakened, the animal threatened
with danger would not have the time and the strong
impulse to get ready for defense or for escape, by
running or by hiding.</p>

<p>The fear instinct is of the utmost importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
in animal life. Looked at from this standpoint the
fear instinct is as important in animal economy
as the skin which covers our body, which, by pain
and hurts, warns of external injurious objects,
and has an important function of warding off incessant
invasion of disease-bearing organisms. In
nervous ills we find the same fundamental factors:&mdash;<em>self-preservation
and the fear instinct</em>.</p>

<br />
STAGES OF FEAR</h2>


<p>The fear instinct in its course of development
passes through three stages:</p>

<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="95%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdr">I.</td><td class="tdl">The Stimulating Stage</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">II.</td><td class="tdl">The Arrestive, or Inhibitory Stage</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tdr">III.</td><td class="tdl">The Paralyzing Stage.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>In its milder forms when the fear instinct is but
nascent, it serves as a sort of trigger to the activities
of the organism. The animal may for a
moment stop whatever activities and pursuits in
which it happens to be engaged, and have its interest
turn in the direction of the particular new
stimulus, whether it be of an auditory, visual, or
olfactory character. The fear instinct is just
strong enough to suspend present interests, and
direct its activities to the new source of the unknown
stimulus.</p>

<p>When the source is unfamiliar, the animal becomes
prepared for action. The energies are aroused for
attack, or for hiding, freezing, or running, according
to the mode of defense to which the animal has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
been adapted in its adjustments to the stimulations
of its environment. The lion, the tiger, the skunk,
the snake, the bird, the rabbit, the squirrel will act
differently, according to their natural disposition
in response to external objects and stimuli.</p>

<p>While the motor system may react differently in
various animals, the fear instinct is alike in all of
them. This stage of the fear instinct should be
regarded as the healthy physiological reaction to
strange and new stimuli, and is essentially protective,
inasmuch as it serves for the arousal of energy
and proper reactions of self-defense, characteristic
of the particular individual.</p>

<p>In its milder forms the fear instinct is <em>normal</em>,
<em>physiological</em>, and healthy in its reactions. In fact,
the absence of it is rather pathological. It is quite
natural that under the influence of some danger,
the organism may feel the urging of this vital instinct,
the consequent of the fundamental life impulse,
and feel it as a stimulus rather than as a
deterrent experience, feel fear as the key for the
unlocking of energies in defense or attack. Such
a reaction is healthy and strictly requisite in the
total economy of life.</p>

<p>When I advanced the theory that the fear instinct
is at the bottom of functional psychosis, or of
psychopathic maladies, some jumped to the conclusion
that I regarded the fear instinct as abnormal,
giving rise to pathological states under all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
conditions and circumstances. This is not correct.
<em>The fear instinct in its initial stages is perfectly
normal, and is as indispensable to life as hunger
and thirst.</em> It is only in the more advanced and
extreme stages that the fear instinct becomes pathological,
and is apt to give rise to psychopathic
states.</p>

<p>In the arrestive or inhibitory state, the innervation
of the voluntary and the involuntary muscular
systems is arrested, or weakened. There is tremor
and even convulsive contractions, the voluntary reactions
are affected, and are carried out with some
difficulty; there is cardiac arrhythmia, the respiration
is irregular; there may be chattering of the
teeth; the various bodily secretions are interfered
with, and the vaso-motor nerves as well as the
general vascular structures are thrown into disorder.
Peristalsis, intestinal secretions, and the innervation
of the sympathetic nervous system may become
affected, first by inhibition, and then by irregular
functioning. Associative mental or cerebral
activity becomes arrested, confused; memory is disturbed,
and the whole personality or individuality
appears in a state of dissociation, accompanied by
a lack of precision and lack of exactness of neuromuscular
adaptations. The delicate reactions and
adaptations are specially affected.</p>

<p>If this stage of fear instinct does not become intensified,
the organism recovers its control,&mdash;many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
of the disturbances pass away, and the following
reaction may come with a greater release of energy,
developing a greater output of activity than
under normal conditions. In short, the fear instinct
may still serve as a stimulation to greater effort,
but the chances of such a result are far smaller than
in the first stage, which is essentially of a stimulating,
useful, and healthful character.</p>

<p>The second stage of the fear instinct is the possibility
of a pathological state, and, if persistent,
leads directly to the third stage with consequent
paralysis and danger of destruction. The first stage
of fear is fully normal, helpful, and self-defensive.
The second stage is harmful, but with the possibility
of recovery and restitution of normal function. The
third stage leads to destruction and death.</p>

<p>In the third stage there is paralysis of function of
most of the muscular, secretory, excretory, circulatory,
intestinal, and nervous systems. The animal
is petrified with fear, and falls into a state of
paralysis, rigidity, cataplexy, or in a state simulating
death. This last stage of the effects of the
fear instinct is pathological, and instead of conducing
to the good of the individual, really leads to
his destruction and death. The fear instinct in its
extreme cases is not a help to the organism, but
is distinctly a hindrance, and is felt as such by the
organism which experiences it.</p>

<p>The fear instinct, which originally is a stimulating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
agent for self-defense, when in excess becomes a
danger hastening the dissolution of the animal organism
into its constituent parts. The intensity
of the fear instinct is the expression of the fact
that the organism is in imminent danger of destruction.
The fear instinct in its extreme state
is decidedly to the disadvantage of the animal.</p>

<p>Of course, it may be claimed that the paralysis
and inhibition stages might have been of service
or of protective value in the lower forms of life,
when mimicking death or freezing prevented the animal
from being noticed. This may possibly hold
true in the cases of lower forms, but in the higher
forms the fear instinct in its third stage, by bringing
about inhibitions and paralysis of the vital
functions, is decidedly of disservice to the organism,
and leads to its destruction and death.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a><a href="#CONTENTS"><span class="fs80">CHAPTER III</span></a><br />
<br />
THE PRIMACY OF FEAR</h2>


<p>The fear instinct is intimately related to the
innermost principle, characteristic of all life, namely
the impulse of self-preservation. When, however,
the fear instinct becomes deranged by being too
intense, and especially when reaching the extreme
stage, the instinct becomes pathological, and its
functioning leads to degeneration, destruction, and
death. Even in its initiatory stages the fear instinct
may become abnormal, when associated with
objects, situations, and sensori-motor reactions
which are otherwise normal and beneficial, or actually
requisite in the total economy of life activity
of the particular organism. Under such conditions
the fear instinct is decidedly pathological.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>In fact we may say that the fear instinct is the
main source of functional, psychopathic diseases.
This also holds true of the individual in his aggregate
capacity. If the impulse of self-preservation
is at the basis of life, the fear instinct is its intimate
companion. We may unhesitatingly assert
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>that the fear instinct is one of the most primitive
instincts of animal life. We are sometimes apt
to overlook the power of fear, because our life is
so well guarded by the protective agencies of civilization
that we can hardly realize the full extent,
depth, and overwhelming effects of the fear instinct.
Fear is rooted deep in the nature of animal life,
in the impulse of self-preservation.</p>

<p>The fear instinct is the earliest instinct to appear
in child life. Preyer observed definite manifestations
of the fear instinct on the twenty-third
day after birth. Perez and Darwin put its appearance
somewhat later. In my observations of child
life I found the manifestation of the fear instinct
during the first couple of weeks, Ribot and other
psychologists regard the fear instinct as “the first
in chronological order of appearance.”</p>

<p>“The progress from brute to man,” says James,
“is characterized by nothing so much as the decrease
in the frequency of the proper occasion for
fear. In civilization in particular it has at last
become possible for large numbers of people to pass
from the cradle to the grave without ever having
had a pang of genuine fear. Many of us need an
attack of mental disease to teach us the meaning
of the word. Hence the possibility of so much
blindly optimistic philosophy and religion. (James
refers here to the blind optimism and cheerful metaphysical
mysticism handed out to the uncultured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
classes.) Fear is a genuine instinct, and one of the
earliest shown by the human child.”</p>

<p>The fear of the unknown, of the unfamiliar, of
the mysterious, is of the utmost consequence in the
life history of children, savages, and barbaric tribes,
and even in the social life of civilized nations. The
fear of coming mysterious, unknown evil is a source
of great anxiety to the young, or to the untrained,
uncultivated minds. All taboos of primitive societies,
of savages, of barbarians, and also of civilized people
take their origin, according to anthropological research,
in the perils and salvation of the soul, or in
the fear of impending evil. As an anthropologist
puts it: “Men are undoubtedly more influenced by
what they fear than by what they love.”</p>

<p>The civilized nations of antiquity used to be
terrorized by omens, by occurrences of an unfamiliar
character, such as storms, thunders, lightnings,
comets, meteors, meteorites, and eclipses.
Affairs of states and wars were guided by superstitions
of fear. Whole armies used to throw away
their weapons and run panic-stricken at the appearance
of meteorites, meteors, and especially of
comets. Even the ancient Athenians were influenced
by strange, meteorological phenomena. On the appearance
of a solar eclipse Pericles saved his ship
by throwing his mantle round the helmsman, telling
him that that was all that an eclipse was, and
that there was no reason to be scared by the veiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of the sun from us. The father of pragmatic
history, the great Thucydides, in his history of the
Peloponnesian wars, puts the appearance of comets
among national disasters.</p>

<p>The fear of the mysterious, the unknown, and the
unfamiliar is a source of anxiety and distress in the
young, or in the untrained and uncultured minds.
Fear may become fixed and morbid when taking
place in early childhood, when not inhibited by the
course of further development, and, all the more so,
when kept up by further events of life.</p>

<p>In most people the instinct of fear is controlled,
regulated by education, and inhibited by the relatively
secure life led in the herd, pack, group, and
society generally. The instinct of fear, however, is
but dormant and requires the opportune moment
such as a social, mental epidemic, a “group-panic,”
to become manifested in its full intensity, giving rise
to a morbid state of the “group-mind,” or “herd-mind.”</p>

<p>There are again cases when even under ordinary
conditions fear becomes developed in the individual
from early childhood either by lack of inhibitory
training or by accidents in early child life. In all
such cases the fear instinct becomes morbid, giving
rise in later life to various forms of mental disease
known as psychopathies, or recurrent morbid states.</p>

<p>We can, therefore, realize the full significance of
the principle laid down by one of the greatest thinkers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
of humanity, Plato, that to learn “What to fear
and what not to fear” is of the utmost consequence
to the individual, both in his private and social
activities.</p>

<p>Throughout the whole domain of the animal kingdom
anything strange and unfamiliar is an occasion
for the awakening of the fear instinct. The strange,
the unfamiliar may be detrimental to the organism,
and the animal recoils from meeting it directly.
There must be exploration made before the reaction
of approach can be effected. We find the same tendency
in children and savages who run in terror of
anything unusual.</p>

<p>On the whole escape is probably the safest course,
since the unfamiliar may prove of great danger.
The well known saying “Familiarity breeds contempt”
has its significance in that the familiar does
not arouse the fear instinct, and can be approached
without risk. Reactions to a familiar object or
known situation run in well established, habitual
grooves.</p>

<p>In man the sense of familiarity may be acquired
by the use of intelligence, by observations of various
forms of unfamiliar situations and strange objects.
Reason, leading to the understanding of the causes
of things, turns the strange and unfamiliar into the
familiar and the known, and thus dispels the terrors
and horrors of the fear instinct.</p>

<p>The function of the intellect is to conquer the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
world by making man at home and familiar in this
“wild universe.” This is the course of human progress.
“The aim of knowledge,” says Hegel, “is to
divest the objective world of its strangeness, and to
make us more at home in it.” In the words of the
ancient poet:</p>

FEAR AND SUPERSTITION</h2>


<p>An individual limited in intelligence, leading a
narrow life, is specially subject to fear suggestions
which can be easily aroused. Inhibitions of the personal
self are produced by stimulation of the fear
instinct with consequent easy access, by means of
fear suggestions, to man’s subconscious fear instinct,
thus inducing various forms of morbid mental life.</p>

<p>When a person is limited in his interests, when he
is ignorant and full of prejudices and superstitions,
his critical, personal sense is embryonic, and the predisposition
to fear suggestions is specially pronounced.
He easily falls a victim to all kinds of
bizarre beliefs and absurd superstitions, such as the
mysticism which obsesses uncultured classes of all
ages.</p>

<p>The optimistic, “metaphysical” beliefs, rampant
in this country, are all due to the beggarly intelligence
subconsciously obsessed by innumerable fear
suggestions. Neurotic adherents cling to their irrational
optimism in order to assuage the pangs,
caused by the fear instinct, from which they are
unable to free themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>In the embryonic personality of the child, as well
as in the undeveloped or narrowed individuality of
the adult, the sense of the strange, of the unknown,
and of the mysterious, is apt to arouse the fear
instinct. In fact, the unfamiliar arouses the fear
instinct even in the more highly organized mind.</p>

<p>“Any new uncertainty,” says Bain, “is especially
the cause of terror. Such are the terrors caused by
epidemics, the apprehensions from an unexperienced
illness, the feeling of a recruit under fire. The mental
system in infancy is highly susceptible, not merely
to pain, but to shocks and surprises. Any great
excitement has a perturbing effect allied to fear.
After the child has contracted a familiarity with the
persons and things around it, it manifests unequivocal
fear on the occurrence of anything strange. The
grasp of an unknown person often gives a fright.
This early experience resembles the manifestations
habitual to the inferior animals.”</p>

<p>In another place Bain rightly says, “Our position
in the world contains the sources of fear. The
vast powers of nature dispose of our lives and happiness
with irresistible might and awful aspect. Ages
had elapsed ere the knowledge of law and uniformity
prevailing among those powers was arrived at by
the human intellect. The profound ignorance of the
primitive man was the soil wherein his early conceptions
and theories sprang up; and the fear inseparable
from ignorance gave them their character.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
The essence of susperstition is expressed by the
definition of fear.”</p>

<p>Compayré, in speaking of the fear of the child,
says, “In his limited experience of evil, by a natural
generalization, he suspects danger everywhere
like a sick person whose aching body dreads in
advance every motion and every contact. He feels
that there is a danger everywhere, behind the things
that he cannot understand, because they do not fit
in with his experience.</p>

<p>“The observations collected by Romanes in his
interesting studies on the intelligence of animals
throw much light on this question; they prove that
dogs, for instance, do not fear this or that, except
as they are ignorant of the cause. A dog was very
much terrified one day when he heard a rumbling
like thunder produced by throwing apples on the
floor of the garret; he seemed to understand the
cause of the noise as soon as he was taken to the
garret, and became as quiet and happy as ever.</p>

<p>“Another dog had a habit of playing with dry
bones. One day Romanes attached a fine thread
which could hardly be seen, to one of the bones, and
while the dog was playing with it, drew it slowly
towards him; the dog recoiled in terror from the
bone, which seemed to be moving of its own accord.
So skittish horses show fright as long as the cause
of the noise that frightens them remains unknown
and invisible to them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>“It is the same with the child. When in the presence
of all the things around him, of which he has
no idea, these sounding objects, these forms, these
movements, whose cause he does not divine, he is
naturally a prey to vague fears. He is just what
we should be, if chance should cast us suddenly into
an unexplored country before strange objects and
strange beings&mdash;suspicious, always on the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">qui vive</i>,
disposed to see imaginary enemies behind every bush,
fearing a new danger at every turn in the road.”</p>

<p>Similarly, Sully says, “The timidity of childhood
is seen in the readiness with which experience invests
objects and places with a fear-exciting aspect, in its
tendency to look at all that is unknown as terrifying,
and in the difficulty of the educator in controlling
these tendencies.”</p>

<p>Sully is right in thinking that education tends
greatly to reduce the early intensity of fear. “This
it does by substituting knowledge for ignorance, and
so undermining that vague terror before the unknown
to which the child and the superstitious savage
are a prey, an effect aided by the growth of will
power and the attitude of self-confidence which this
brings with it.” An uncultivated personality with
a limited mental horizon, with a narrow range of
interests, a personality trained in the fear of mysterious
agencies, is a fit subject for obsessions.</p>

<p><ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'In certain types of fuctional psychosis'">In certain types of functional psychosis</ins> and neurosis
the patient has an inkling of the fear instinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
in his dread of objects, or of states of mind, lack of
confidence, blushing, expectations of some coming
misfortune and some mysterious evil, but he is not
aware of the fear instinct as developed in him by
the events and training of early childhood. <em>The
fears of early childhood are subconscious.</em> At any
rate, the patient does not connect them with his present
mental affection.</p>

<p>In other types of psychopathic affections the
patient is entirely unaware of the whole situation,
he is engrossed by the symptoms which he regards as
the sum and substance of his trouble; the fear is
entirely subconscious. Frights, scares, dread of
sickness, instructions associated with fear of the mysterious
and unseen, injunctions with fear of punishment
or failure in moral standards, enforcement of
social customs with dread of failure and degradation,&mdash;all
go to the cultivation of the fear instinct which
in later life becomes manifested as <em>functional
psychosis</em> or <em>neurosis</em>.</p>

<p><em>Functional psychosis or neurosis is an obsession,
conscious and subconscious, of the fear instinct.</em>
Thus one of my patients became obsessed with fear
of tuberculosis, manifesting most of the symptoms
of “consumption,” after a visit to a tubercular
friend. Another patient was obsessed by the fear
of death after visiting a sick relative of his in one
of the city hospitals. Another became obsessed with
the fear of syphilis after having been in contact with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
a friend who had been under antiluetic treatment.
Still another of my patients, in addition to the fear
of darkness, became obsessed with the fear of stars,
and also with a fear of comets, regarded by some
people as poisoning the air with noxious gases.</p>

<p>In all such cases anxiety and dread were present,
but in none of the patients have I found an insight
into the real state of the mind. In all of them the
fear was traced to early childhood, to early experiences
of the fear instinct, fostered and fortified by
unfavorable conditions. In all of those fears there
was a long history of a well-developed <em>subconscious
fear instinct</em>.</p>

<p>I may assert without hesitation that in all my
cases of functional psychosis, I find the presence of
the fear instinct to be the sole cause of the malady.
<em>Take away the fear and the psychosis or neurosis
disappears.</em></p>

<p>The fear instinct arises from the impulse of self-preservation
without which animal life cannot exist.
The fear instinct is one of the most primitive and
most fundamental of all instincts. Neither hunger,
nor sex, nor maternal instinct, nor social instinct
can compare with the potency of the fear instinct,
rooted as it is in self-preservation,&mdash;the condition of
life primordial.</p>

<p>When the instinct of fear is at its height, it sweeps
before it all other instincts. Nothing can withstand
a panic. Functional psychosis in its full development<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
is essentially a panic,&mdash;it is the emergence of
the most powerful of all instincts, the fear instinct.</p>

<p>Functional psychosis or neurosis is a veiled form
of the fear of death, of destruction, of loss of what
is deemed as essential to life, of fear of some unknown,
impending evil. How many times has it fallen
to my share to soothe and counteract the fear
instinct of panic-stricken psychopathic patients! A
psychogenetic examination of every case of functional
psychosis brings one invariably to the fundamental
fear instinct.</p>

<p>Conflicts, repressions, imperfections, sex-complexes,
sex-aberrations, and others do not produce
psychopathic symptoms or neurotic states. It is
only when mental states become associated with an
exaggerated impulse of self-preservation and an
intensified fear instinct that neurosis arises.</p>

<p>A close study of every neurotic case clearly discloses
the <em>primary</em> action of those two important
factors of life activity,&mdash;self-preservation and fear
instinct.</p>

<br />
THE POWER OF FEAR</h2>


<p>The function of fear is quite clear. Fear is the
guardian instinct of life. The intensity of the struggle
for existence and the preservation of life of the
animal are expressed in the instinct of fear. The
fear instinct in its mild form, when connected with
what is strange and unfamiliar, or with what is
really dangerous to the animal, is of the utmost
consequence to the life existence of the animal. What
is strange and unfamiliar may be a menace to life,
and it is a protection, if under such conditions the
fear instinct is aroused.</p>

<p>Again, it is of the utmost importance in weak
animals, such as hares or rabbits, to have the fear
instinct easily aroused by the slightest, strange
stimulus: the animal is defenseless, and its refuge,
its safety, is in running. The unfamiliar stimulus
may be a signal of danger, and it is safer to get away
from it; the animal cannot take chances.</p>

<p>On the other hand, animals that are too timid, so
that even the familiar becomes too suspicious, cannot
get their food, and cannot leave a progeny,&mdash;they
become eliminated by the process of natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
selection. There is a certain amount of trust that
nature demands even of its most defenseless and
timid children.</p>

<p>Animals in whom the fear instinct can be aroused
to a high degree become paralyzed and perish.
Under such conditions the fear instinct not only
ceases to be of protective value, but is the very one
that brings about the destruction of the animal
possessed by it. Intense fear paralyzes the animal.</p>

<p>“One of the most terrible effects of fear,” says
Mosso, “is the paralysis which allows neither of
escape nor defense. Not all the phenomena of fear
can be explained on the theory of natural selection.
In their extreme degree they are morbid phenomena,
indicating imperfection of the organism. One might
almost say that nature had not been able to find a
substance for brain and spinal cord which should be
extremely sensitive, and yet should never, under the
influence of exceptional or unusual stimuli, exceed
in its reactions those physiological limits which are
best adapted to the preservation of the animal.”
Mosso quotes Haller to the effect that “phenomena
of fear common to animals are not aimed at the
preservation of the timid, but at their destruction.”</p>

<p>The fear instinct is no doubt one of the most
fundamental and one of the most vital of animal
instincts, but when it rises to an extreme degree,
or when associated with familiar instead of strange
and unfamiliar objects, then we may agree with Haller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
that the phenomena are not aimed at the preservation
of the animal, but at its destruction; or, as
Darwin puts it, are of “disservice to the animal.”
This is just what is found in the case of psychopathic
or neurotic affections. The fear instinct,
when aroused and cultivated in early childhood, becomes
associated in later life with particular events,
objects, and special states.</p>

<p>When the instinct of fear is aroused in connection
with some future impending misfortune, the feeling
of apprehension with all its physiological changes,
muscular, respiratory, cardiac, epigastric, and intestinal,
goes to form that complex feeling of anxiety
so highly characteristic of the acute varieties of
psychopathic maladies. When fear reaches its acme,
the heart is specially affected; circulatory and
respiratory changes become prominent, giving rise
to that form of oppression which weighs like an
incubus on the patient,&mdash;the feeling known as “precordial
anxiety.”</p>

<p>The fear instinct is the ultimate cause of functional
psychosis,&mdash;it is the soil on which grow luxuriantly
the infinite varieties of psychopathic disturbances.
The body, sense, intellect, and will are
all profoundly affected by the irresistible sweep of
the fear instinct, as manifested in the overwhelming
feeling of anxiety. The fear instinct and its offsprings&mdash;hesitation,
anxiety, conflicts and repressions&mdash;weaken,
dissociate, and paralyze the functions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
of the body and mind, producing the various
symptoms of psychopathic diseases. The fear instinct
keeps on gnawing at the very vitals of the
psychopathic patient.</p>

<p>Even at his best the psychopathic patient is not
free from the workings of the fear instinct, from the
feeling of anxiety which, as the patients themselves
put it, “hangs like a cloud on the margin or fringe
of consciousness.” From time to time he can hear
the distant, threatening rumbling of the fear instinct.
Even when the latter is apparently stilled, the pangs
of anxiety torment the patient like a dull toothache.</p>

<p>Montaigne, writing of fear, says, “I am not so
good a naturalist (as they call it) as to discern by
what secret springs fear has its motion in us; but
be this as it may, it is a strange passion, and such
a one as the physicians say there is no other whatever
that sooner dethrones our judgment from its
proper seat; which is so true, that I myself have
seen very many become frantic through fear; and
even in those of the best settled temper, it is most
certain that it begets a terrible confusion during the
fit. Even among soldiers, a sort of men over whom,
of all others, it ought to have the least power, how
often has it converted flocks of sheep into armed
squadrons, reeds and bullrushes into pikes and lances,
and friends into enemies....</p>

<p>“The thing in the world I am most afraid of is
fear. That passion alone, in the trouble of it, exceeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
all other accidents. Such as have been well
banged in some skirmish, may yet, all wounded and
bloody as they are, be brought on again the next day
to the charge; but such as have once conceived a
good sound fear of the enemy will never be made so
much as to look the enemy in the face. Such as are
in immediate fear of losing their estates, of banishment
or of slavery, live in perpetual anguish, and
lose all appetite and repose. And the many people
who, impatient of perpetual alarms of fear, have
hanged or drowned themselves, or dashed themselves
to pieces, give us sufficiently to understand that fear
is more importunate and insupportable than death
itself.”</p>

<p>A well known writer, who is a psychopathic sufferer,
writes: “Carlyle laid his finger upon the truth,
when he said that the reason why the pictures of the
past were always so golden in tone, so delicate in
outline, was because the quality of fear was taken
from them. It is the fear of what may be and what
must be that overshadows present happiness; and if
fear is taken from us, we are happy. The strange
thing is that we can not learn not to be afraid, even
though all the darkest and saddest of our experiences
have left us unscathed; and if we could but find a
reason for the mingling of fear with our lives, we
should have gone towards the solving of the riddle
of the world.”</p>

<p>Anxiety states of neuroses and psychoses are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
essentially clue to the awakening of the fear instinct,
normally present in every living being. The fear
instinct is a fundamental one; it is only inhibited by
the whole course of civilization and by the training
and education of life. Like the jinn of the
“Arabian Nights,” it slumbers in the breast of every
normal individual, and comes fully to life in the
various neuroses and psychoses.</p>

<p>Kraepelin and his school lay special stress on the
fact that “Fear is by far the most important persistent
emotion in morbid conditions.... Fear is
manifested by anxious excitement and by anxious
tension.” “Experience,” says Kraepelin, “shows an
intimate relationship between insistent psychosis and
the so-called ‘phobias,’ the <em>anxiety states</em> which in
such patients become associated with definite impressions,
actions, and views.” The states are associated
with the thought of some unknown danger.
Violent heart action, pallor, a feeling of anxiety,
tremor, cold sweat, meteorisms, diarrhœa, polyuria,
weakness in the legs, fainting spells, attack the
patient, who may lose control of his limbs and occasionally
suffer complete collapse.</p>

<p>“These states,” says Kraepelin, with his usual insight
into abnormal mental life, “remind one of the
feeling of anxiety which in the case of healthy people
may, in view of a painful situation or of a serious
danger, deprive one of the calmness of judgment and
confidence in his movements.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, we find from different standpoints that the
feeling of anxiety with its accompanying phenomena
is one of the most potent manifestations of animal
instincts, the fear instinct, which is at the basis of
all psychopathic, neurotic maladies.</p>

<p>The fear instinct, as the subtle and basic instinct
of life, is well described by Kipling:&mdash;</p>

<p>It is interesting to learn what a practical and
thoughtful surgeon, such as George Crile, has to say
on the matter of fear. Dr. Crile lays stress on the
facts that in his researches he finds evidence that the
phenomena of fear have a physical basis similar to
those morphological changes in the brain cells observed
in certain stages of surgical shock and in
fatigue.... That the brain is definitely damaged
by fear may be proved by experiments.</p>

<p>“According to Sherrington the nervous system
responds in action as a whole, and to but one stimulus
at a time.... Under the influence of fear
or (fear of) injury the integration of the common
path is most nearly absolute.... Hence fear
and injury (or fear of injury) drain the cup of
energy to the dregs....</p>

<p>“We can understand why it is a patient consumed
by fear suffers so many bodily impairments, (so
many functional disturbances) and diseases even.
We can understand the grave digestive and metabolic
disturbances under strain of fear.... We
can understand the variations in the gastric analyses
in a timid patient alarmed over his condition and
afraid of the hospital. The patient is integrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
by fear, and since fear takes precedence over all other
impulses, no organ can function normally (under the
influence of fear)” ... Dr. Crile arrives at the conclusion
that “Fear dominates the various organs and
parts of the body....”</p>

<p>Dr. Crile lays special stress on the pathological
character of the fear instinct: “That the brain is
definitely influenced, damaged even, by fear has been
proved by the following experiments: Rabbits were
frightened by a dog, but were neither injured nor
chased. After various periods of time the animals
were killed and their brain cells compared with the
brain cells of normal animals, wide-spread changes
were seen (in the brain cells of the animals affected
by fear). The principal clinical phenomena expressed
by the rabbits were rapid heart, accelerated
respiration, prostration, tremors, and a rise in temperature.
The dog showed similar phenomena, excepting
that, instead of such muscular relaxation
as was shown by the rabbit, it exhibited aggressive
muscular action.”</p>

<p>Animals in which the fear instinct can be aroused
to a high degree become paralyzed and perish. The
animal mechanism is by no means perfect. A stab
in the heart, a rip in the abdomen, a cut of the carotids,
a prick in the medulla, a scratch of a needle
infected with anthrax, or tetanus bacilli, a drop of
hydrocyanic acid, an arrow tipped with curare,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
extinguish every spark of life. Organic material
may be delicate and complex, but for that reason it
is highly imperfect and vulnerable.</p>

<p>Living matter is the feeblest material in nature,
and is as fragile as a delicate crystal vase. Protoplasm,
or living matter, may be wonderful material,
but it can be crushed with a pebble. The most
beautiful colors may be displayed by a thin, delicate
bubble, but it bursts at the least touch. Living
matter is like a bubble, like foam on the ocean. Perhaps
no better material is available for the functions
of life.</p>

<p>Meanwhile it remains true that the flimsiness of
living material makes it easily subject to decay and
destruction. It is a profound error, having its root
in prejudice, that nature always helps, and that the
processes going on in the organism are always of
benefit to the individual. Nature is as ready to
destroy life as to protect it.</p>

<p>Preservation or destruction of a particular individual
depends on the fact as to whether or no
normal or pathological processes predominate in the
total economy of the organism. This holds true of
the fear instinct. The fear instinct is a delicate
mechanism, and when its action is slightly intensified,
the animal is on the way to destruction. For the
cosmic forces are careless of the creatures which
keep on pouring forth in generous profusion from

<p>Living matter, or protoplasm can only exist under
special, restricted conditions,&mdash;the least variation
means death. The more complicated, and more
organized protoplasm is, the more restricted are the
conditions of its existence. A rise of a couple of
degrees of temperature or a fall means disease and
death. The same holds true of the rise and fall of
quantity and quality of bodily secretion of glands
and of other organs. Protoplasm can only exist in
an <em>optimum</em> environment. Any change spells disease
and death.</p>

<p>The fear instinct, being at the heart of highly
organized life activities, is delicately responsive to
any changes and variations from the <em>optimum</em>, requisite
for the proper functioning of the organism. Any
deviation from the <em>optimum</em> environment, external
or internal, produces corresponding changes in the
fear instinct with consequent pathological changes in
the organism.</p>

<p>The fear instinct like a delicate indicator is the
first to get deranged, with harmful results to the
organism as a whole. We can thus realize the importance
of keeping the fear instinct in good condition.
We can understand the significance of
Plato’s doctrine of rational guidance of the fear
instinct. “What to fear and what not to fear” is
at the basis of all organized life, individual and
social.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

FEAR AND DISEASE</h2>


<p>If we examine closely the symptoms of fear, we
invariably find the symptoms of functional psychosis
or neurosis. Fear affects the muscular and sensory
systems, the vasomotor system, the respiratory system,
the sudorific glands, the viscera, the heart, the
intestines, all organs and functions of the organism.</p>

<p>Bain, in describing the emotions of fear or terror,
says, “Terror on the physical side shows both a loss
and a transfer of nervous energy. The appearances
may be distributed between the effects of relaxation
and effects of tension. The relaxation is seen, as
regards the muscles, in the dropping of the jaw, in
the collapse overtaking all organs not specially
excited, in trembling of the lips and other parts,
and in the loosening of the sphincters. Next, as
regards the organic processes and viscera. The
digestion is everywhere weakened; the flow of saliva
is checked, the gastric secretion arrested (appetite
failing), the bowels deranged; the respiration is enfeebled.
The heart and circulation are disturbed;
there is either a flushing of the face or a deadly pallor.
The skin shows symptoms&mdash;the cold sweat, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
altered odor of the perspiration, the creeping action
that lifts the hair. The kidneys are directly or indirectly
affected. The sexual organs feel the depressing
influence. The secretion of milk in the mother’s
breast is vitiated.”</p>

<p>Darwin gives the following description of fear:&mdash;</p>

<p>“The frightened man at first stands like a statue,
motionless and breathless, or crouches down as if to
escape observation. The heart beats quickly and
violently, but it is very doubtful if it then works
more efficiently than usual so as to send a greater
supply of blood to the body; for the skin instantly
becomes pale, as during incipient faintness. The
paleness of the surface, however, is probably in large
part or is exclusively due to the vasomotor center
being affected in such a manner as to cause the contraction
of the small arteries of the skin. That the
skin is much affected under the sense of great fear
we see in the marvelous manner in which the perspiration
immediately exudes from it. This exudation
is all the more remarkable as the surface is then
cold, and hence the term, a cold sweat; whereas the
sudorofic glands are properly excited into action
when the surface is heated. The hairs also on the
skin stand erect, and the superficial muscles shiver.
In connection with the disturbed action of the heart
the breathing is hurried. The salivary glands act
imperfectly; the mouth becomes dry and is often
opened and shut. I have also noticed that under
slight fear there is a slight tendency to yawn. One<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of the best symptoms is the trembling of all the muscles
of the body. From this cause and from the dryness
of the mouth, the voice becomes husky or
indistinct, or may altogether fail.”</p>

<p>If we turn now to the manifestations of psychopathic
maladies, we meet with the same fear symptoms:&mdash;</p>

<p>(a) The attacks may be muscular, involving
symptoms such as trembling, shaking, paresis,
paralysis, or rigidity; there may be affection of
locomotion or of muscular co-ordination.</p>

<p>(b) There may be sensory disturbances,&mdash;anesthesia,
paresthesia, analgesia, or hyperalgesia as well
as affection of muscular sense and kinesthesia.</p>

<p>(c) There may be skin disturbances, such as
arrest of perspiration or profuse perspiration, especially
under the influence of emotions, worry, and
fatigue; such perspiration may also occur at night,
and in some cases the fear of tuberculosis may be
associated with such conditions.</p>

<p>(d) The lungs may become affected functionally,
and there may occur respiratory disturbances;
coughing, hawking, apnea, dyspnea, and asthmatic
troubles.</p>

<p>(e) The heart becomes affected, bringing about
precordial pain; palpitation of the heart, bradycardia,
tachycardia, and cardiac arrhythmia.</p>

<p>(f) The stomach and intestines become affected,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
indigestion and vague fugitive soreness and pain
may be experienced all over or in special regions of
the abdomen; constipation or diarrhea may ensue.</p>

<p>(g) The renal apparatus may become affected
and its activity arrested, or, as is more often the
case in the milder forms of psychopathic troubles,
there may be present an alteration in the amount or
frequency of micturition, such as is found in the
conditions of anuria and polyuria.</p>

<p>(h) Menstruation becomes disturbed, and we may
meet with conditions of dysmenorrhea, amenorrhea,
menorrhagia, and other disturbances of the tubes,
ovaries, and uterus.</p>

<p>(i) There are disturbances of the nervous system,
such as headache and a general dull sensation of
fatigue and paresis of all mental functions, with
dizziness and vertigo.</p>

<p>On the mental side we find in the psychopathies
the following disturbances:&mdash;</p>

<p>(a) Affections of perceptual activity,&mdash;illusions
and hallucinations.</p>

<p>(b) Affections of intellectual activity,&mdash;argumentativeness
in regard to insignificant things.</p>

<p>(c) Affections of the moral sense,&mdash;scrupulousness,
over-conscientiousness, not living up to ideal
states.</p>

<p>(d) Affections of religious life,&mdash;fear of commission
of sins and terror of punishment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>(e) Affections of social life,&mdash;timidity, blushing,
etc.</p>

<p>(f) Affections in regard to objects, such as astrophobia,
acmephobia, agoraphobia, claustrophobia,
etc.</p>

<p>(g) Affections of conceptual life,&mdash;insistent ideas.</p>

<p>(h) Affections of the attention,&mdash;aprosexia.</p>

<p>(i) Affections of the will,&mdash;states of aboulia, indecision,
discord, conflicts, and uncontrollable impulses.</p>

<p>(j) Affections of the memory,&mdash;amnesic and paramnesic
states.</p>

<p>(k) General mental fatigue.</p>

<p>(l) Affections of sexual life,&mdash;impotence, perversion,
and inversion.</p>

<p>(m) Affections in regard to marital relations.</p>

<p>(n) Affections in regard to personal life,&mdash;diffidence,
self-condemnation, self-depreciation.</p>

<p>(o) Affections of apparent loss of personality,&mdash;feeling
of self gone.</p>

<p>(p) Formation of new personalities,&mdash;dual and
multiple personality.</p>

<p>In connection with all such neurotic affections we
find invariably present a feeling of unrest, hesitation,
doubt, conflict, discord, uneasiness, a feeling of
anxiety, <em>conscious or subconscious</em>, feeling of some
impending evil. In all such affections we find the
brooding spirit of the most powerful of all animal
instincts,&mdash;the fear instinct. <em>Neurosis is a disease of
self-preservation and fear.</em></p>

<br />
FORMS OF NEUROSIS</h2>


<p>A brief outline of a classification of nervous and
mental diseases, made by me in my various works,
may be of help towards a clear understanding of
neurotic disturbances.</p>

<p>The different forms of nervous and mental diseases
may be classified into <em>Organic</em> and <em>Functional</em>.</p>

<p>By <em>organic</em> affections I mean to indicate pathological
modifications of the neuron and its processes
taking place in the very structure (probably the
cytoreticulum) of the nerve cell. Under this category
come such maladies as general paresis, dementia
praecox, all mental and nervous affections of a
degenerative and involutionary character. Such diseases
are termed by me <em>Organopathies</em>, or <em>Necropathies</em>.</p>

<p>By <em>functional</em> affections I mean to indicate all
neuron changes in which the functions of the neuron
and its reactions to external and internal stimulations
are involved in the pathological process without,
however, affecting the anatomical structure of
the nerve cell. The pathological changes are not permanent,&mdash;recovery
of normal function is possible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
with the restitution of favorable conditions of nutrition
and elimination.</p>

<p>Functional nervous and mental diseases are in
turn subdivided into <em>Neuropathies</em> and <em>Psychopathies</em>.</p>

<p>Neuropathic diseases are disturbances of functioning
activity, due to defective neuron matabolism,
brought about by external stimuli, and more specially
by harmful internal stimuli&mdash;glandular secretions,
hormones, toxic and autotoxic agencies. The
pathological, neuropathic process produces few, if
any anatomical, changes in the structure of the neuron.
The pathology of neuropathic diseases, (probably
of the cytoplasm) is essentially <em>chemico-physiological</em>
in nature.</p>

<p>Neuropathic diseases include maladies in which
the neuron undergoes degenerative changes. At first
there is an apparent increase, then an inhibition, and
finally a complete suspension of neuron function, not
terminating in the destruction of the neuron. Neuron
restitution is possible.</p>

<p>Such affections are produced by mild poisons,
organic, or inorganic, by autotoxic products, by
hyposecretion or hypersecretion, or by absence of
hormones in the economy of the organism. Here
belong all the temporary, or recurrent maniacal,
melancholic, delusional states, puerperal mania, epileptic
insanity, the mental aberrations of adolescent
and climacteric periods, periodic insanity, alternating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
insanities, and in general all the mental affections
known under the description of manic-depressive
insanity.</p>

<p>Where the disease depends on the <em>interrelation</em> of
neurons in a complex group, on <em>association of systems</em>
of neurons, the condition is <em>psychopathic</em> in
nature.</p>

<p>In psychopathic troubles the neuron itself may
remain unaffected, may be perfectly normal and
healthy. The disorder is due to association with
systems of neurons which are usually not called into
action by the function of that particular neuron
system.</p>

<p>By <em>Organopathies</em> or <em>Necropathies</em> I indicate a
group of psychophysiological symptoms, accompanied
by structural, necrotic changes of the neuron, terminating
in the ultimate death of the neuron systems,
involved in the pathological process.</p>

<p>By <em>Neuropathies</em> I indicate a group of psychophysiological
manifestations due to pathological
functional neuron modifications, capable of restitution
through normal metabolism.</p>

<p>By <em>Psychopathies</em> I designate pathological phenomena
of psychophysiological dissociation and disaggregation
of neuron systems and their functions
in clusters, the neuron itself and its special function
remaining undamaged.</p>

<p>The psychopathies are further subdivided into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
<em>Somatopsychoses</em> and <em>Psychoneuroses</em> or <em>Neuropsychoses</em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Somatopsychoses are characterized by somatic
symptoms</em>, by disturbances of bodily functions,
such as paralysis, contractures, convulsions, anesthesia,
analgesia, hyperalgesia, and other sensory
disturbances, as well as by intestinal, cardiac, respiratory,
and genito-urinary troubles.</p>

<p>The <em>psychoneuroses or Neuropsychoses are characterized
by mental symptoms</em>. The patient’s whole
mind is occupied with mental troubles.</p>

<p>Such conditions are found in obsessions, fixed
ideas, imperative impulses, emotional compulsions,
and other allied mental and nervous maladies.</p>

<p>Somatopsychoses simulate physical and organic
nervous troubles. Thus, many “hysterical” forms
simulate tabes, or paralysis agitans, hemiplegia,
paraplegia, or epilepsy, while many of the neurasthenic,
hypochondriacal, and their allied states may
simulate tumor, cancer, intestinal and glandular derangements,
cardiac, laryngeal, pneumonic, hepatic,
splanchnic ovarian, tubal, uterine, renal, and other
bodily afflictions.</p>

<p>The neuropsychoses or psychoneuroses simulate
all forms of mental disease, beginning with melancholia
and mania, and ending with general paresis
and dementia.</p>

<p><em>Psychoneurosis</em> and <em>somatopsychosis</em> are diseases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
of the subconscious; in the former mental, in the latter
physical symptoms predominate.</p>

<p><em>Psychopathic states should be rigidly differentiated
from other disturbances, such as neuropathies
and organopathies, or necropathies.</em> The following
diagram may be of help:</p>

<br />
FEAR AND THE HYPNOIDAL STATE</h2>


<p>In my work on “Sleep” I report a series of interesting
experiments carried out by me on guinea
pigs, rabbits, cats, dogs, children, and adults.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I
discovered one of the most important states of animal
life, a state which I termed <em>hypnoidal</em>.</p>

<p>The study shows that in almost every animal, from
the lowest to the highest, from frog to man, a somewhat
sudden change of the usual environment deprives
that animal of its activities and its functions.
If the change is not too intense and prolonged, the
animal merges into the hypnoidal state in which the
lost functions are restored. During this hypnoidal
state the functions are weakened, the animal may be
regarded in a state of invalidism, its reactions being
enfeebled, practically speaking, paretic.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is advisable to approach the phenomena
from their more striking aspect. In seizing
a triton, salamander, or frog, and stretching it
on the table, one will observe with surprise that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
animal remains in the same position given it. The
most uncomfortable and bizarre position may be
given to the limbs, and still the animal will not move.
Testing the extremities one finds them rigid and
resisting. Something similar we find in the hypnotic
condition, when under the suggestion that the extremities
are rigid, and they cannot be moved by
the subject. The same can be done with a lobster
and other animals of the same type.</p>

<p>Everyone has heard of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">experimentum mirabile</i>
made by Kirchner in the seventeenth century. A
rooster or hen is seized, the legs are tied with a
string and the bird is put on the ground. A piece
of chalk is passed over the beak,&mdash;the chalk tracing
a line from beak to some distant point on the ground.
When the bird is released, it remains in the same
position. Some explain that the animal is kept
prisoner, because it “imagines” that it is bound by
the line of chalk. The chalk, however, is unnecessary.
The animal may be seized, shouted in its ear, or kept
down forcibly, and the same result will happen. This
state has been termed by Preyer “cataplexy.” The
phenomenon can also be produced in insects, in mollusca.</p>

<p>Many investigators have been interested in this
phenomenon. I have devoted a good deal of work
to this condition which is also found in mammals in
which it is induced by the fear instinct. In mammals,
however, the state of cataplexy is not necessarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
accompanied by rigidity, although it may be
present, but there is a complete loss of voluntary
activity. Horses tremble violently and become paralyzed
at the sight of a beast of prey, such as a
tiger or a lion. At the sight of a serpent, monkeys
are known to be in such an intense state of fear that
they are unable to move, and thus fall easy victims
to the reptile.</p>

<p>Under similar conditions birds are so paralyzed
by fear that they are unable to fly away from the
source of danger, and fall a prey to the threatening
serpent. The birds resemble very much the
hypnotized subject in a state of catalepsy. Although
the gibbons are the most agile of all the
simians, they are easily taken by surprise, and captured
without any resistance,&mdash;they are paralyzed
by fear. Seals when pursued on land become so
frightened that they are unable to offer any opposition
to their pursuers, and let themselves easily be
captured and killed.</p>

<p>In large cities one can often witness nervous people
affected suddenly by the presence of danger;
they remain immobile, in the middle of the street,
becoming exposed to fatal accidents. The fear instinct
paralyzes their activities, they are petrified
with terror.</p>

<p>I was told by people who have experienced the
effects of earthquakes, that during the time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
earthquakes they were unable to move, and the same
condition was observed in animals, especially in
young dogs. It is hard to move cattle and horses
from a burning stable, on account of the fear of fire
which obsesses the animals, so that they become
paralyzed, suffocated and burnt to death. So vital
is the fear instinct that the least deviation from the
normal state is apt to play havoc with the safety of
the individual.</p>

<p>The fear instinct is the most primitive, the most
fundamental, and the most powerful of all instincts.
When the fear instinct is let loose, the animal succumbs.
We should not wonder, therefore, that with
the aberration of the fear instinct, the life guardian
of the individual, all orientation is lost, the
animal becomes demoralized, and the organism goes
to destruction. No other instinct can surpass the
fear instinct in its fatal effects.</p>

<p>The more one studies the facts, the more one
examines various psychopathic, functional maladies,
without going into any speculations and without
being blinded by foregone conclusions and pseudo-scientific
hypotheses, the more one is driven to the
conclusion that the fear instinct is at the bottom
of all those nervous and mental aberrations, conscious
and subconscious.</p>

<p>The infinite varieties of functional psychopathic
diseases are the consequences of some abnormal association<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
with the fear instinct which alone gives rise
to the infirmities characteristic of functional mental
maladies.</p>

<p>President Stanley Hall accepts my view of the
subject. In a recent paper he writes: “If there be
a vital principle, fear must be one of its close allies
as one of the chief springs of the mind”.... In
spite of his former psychoanalytic inclinations
President Hall asserts now that “Freud is wrong in
interpreting this most generic form of fear as rooted
in sex. <em>Sex anxieties themselves are rooted in the
larger fundamental impulse of self-preservation with
its concomitant instinct of fear.</em>” This is precisely
the factor and the teaching which I have been expounding
in all my works on Psychopathology.</p>

<p>So deeply convinced is Professor Stanley Hall of
the primitive and fundamental character of the fear
instinct, that he refers to the facts that “if the cerebrum
is removed, animals, as Goltz and Bechterev
have proved, manifest very intense symptoms of
fear, and so do human monsters born without brains,
of hemicephalic children, as Sternberg and Lotzko
have demonstrated.”</p>

<p>The fear instinct is of such vital importance that
it is found in animals after decerebration, and persists
in animals after spino-vago-sympathetic section.
Sherrington found the fear instinct present
in dogs after section of the spinal cord and also
after complete section of the vago-sympathetic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
nerves, thus removing all sensations coming from
the viscera, muscles, and skin, below the shoulder,
leaving only the sensations from the front paws, head
and cerebral activity. The dog was a sort of cerebral
animal. The whole body below the shoulder,
skin, muscle, viscera, were all anaesthetic, and yet
the fear instinct remained intact.</p>

<p>On the other hand, after complete ablation of the
cerebral hemispheres of the dog, so that the animal
became spinal, all cerebral functions being totally
wiped out, Goltz invariably found that the fear
instinct remained unimpaired. <em>The fear instinct is
inherent in animal life&mdash;existence. As long as there
is life, there is fear.</em></p>

<p>So potent, all embracing, and all pervading is the
fear instinct, that the physician must reckon with it
in his private office, in the hospital, and in the surgical
operating room. In a number of my cases psychognosis,
the study and examination of mental
states, clearly reveals the fact that even where the
neurosis has not originated in a surgical trauma,
surgical operations reinforced, developed, and fixed
psychopathic conditions.</p>

<p>The fear instinct is one of the most primitive and
most fundamental of all instincts. Neither hunger,
nor sex, nor maternal instinct, nor social instinct
can compare with the potency of the fear instinct,
rooted as it is in the conditions of life primordial.</p>

<p>When the instinct of fear is at its height it sweeps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
before it all other instincts. Nothing can withstand
a panic. Functional psychosis in its full development
is essentially a panic. A psychogenetic examination
of every case of functional psychosis brings
one invariably to the basic instinct of life, self preservation
and the fear instinct.</p>

<p>As Whittier puts it:</p>

<p class="verse">Still behind the tread I hear</p>

HEALTH AND MORBIDITY</h2>


<p>While health cannot be separated from disease by
a sharp line, the two are relative and fluctuating.
Still, on the whole, the two can be differentiated by
the criterion of hurt and dissolution. Any process
or state conducive to hurt, and tending to dissolution
of the organism may be regarded as pathological
or abnormal. The same criterion should be
applied, when differentiating the healthy, normal
states of instincts and emotions from abnormal and
morbid states of instinctive and emotional activities.
Those states that further life activities are healthy,
normal; those that hinder life are morbid.</p>

<p>The same holds true of the fear instinct. Every
form of fear which, instead of helping or furthering
vigor of life, instead of stimulating living energy,
instead of being a protection, becomes a hindrance,
a menace to the organism, is accompanied with suffering
and distress, and ultimately leads to destruction,
should be regarded as essentially morbid.</p>

<p>The following are the chief characteristics of
morbid instinctive and emotional states:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>I. When they are <em>disproportionate</em> to the cause.</p>

<p>II. When they are chronic.</p>

<p>III. When their feeling-tone is <em>painful</em>, <em>distressing</em>.</p>

<p>IV. When they are <em>non-adaptive</em> to the stimulations.</p>

<p>V. When the reactions are <em>not adjusted</em> to the
external environment.</p>

<p>VI. When they are <em>uncontrollable</em>.</p>

<p>VII. When coming in <em>recurrent</em> or <em>periodic attacks</em>.</p>

<p>VIII. When the physical and mental reactions
are of <em>great intensity</em>.</p>

<p>IX. When they are <em>dissociative</em>.</p>

<p>X. When they lead to <em>dissolution</em>.</p>

<p>Fear is not a matter of belief. To regard fear as
a form of belief, is fallacious, dangerous, and suicidal.
It is as dangerous as to consider smallpox
and cholera the result of faith. We must never forget
that fear is one of the most fundamental of animal
instincts having its roots deep down in animal
life existence. To ignore this fact is suicidal.</p>

<p>According to the great anthropologist, Galton:
“Every antelope in South Africa has to run for its
life every one or two days, and the antelope starts
and gallops under the influence of a false alarm
many times a day. Fear is a fundamental condition
of animal existence.”</p>

<p>The fear instinct in its healthy normal state is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
protection and defense. As Ribot puts it: “The
basis of fear exists in the organism, forms part of
the constitution of animals and man, and helps them
to live by a defensive adaptation:” In fact, we may
even go to the point of affirming that the fear
instinct, like all other healthy, normal instincts, is
absolutely requisite in the total economy of animal
and human life.</p>

<p>In man, however, fear should not be at the mercy
of blind animal instincts and reflexes, but should be
guided and controlled by reason, by reflection, by
scientific, medical measures, by scientific sanitation,
by physical and mental hygiene, and by the rational
cultivation and development of all human functions
and faculties.</p>

<p>One of the greatest Greek thinkers well puts it:
“Imbeciles, fools, and the mad alone have no understanding
of fear. True education, true reason, and
true courage consist in the knowledge of what to
fear and what not to fear.”</p>

<p>Mysticism, occultism, and credulity act like virulent
germs, fatal to man. “Metaphysical” cults anesthetize
the intellect, put judgment into lethargic
sleep from which there is no awaking. Mysticism
kills the most precious essence of man’s life,&mdash;the
critical sense of human personality.</p>

<p>Occultism, mysticism, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et id genus omne</i> declare
that “fear is a false belief, an error of the mortal
mind.” Mystics claim the “unreality” of the material<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
fear instinct of which they are in “reality” in
“mortal” terror. This zealous negation of fear is
its strongest affirmation.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, fear is one of the most stern
realities of life. The neurotic in denying disease,
evil, and fear is like the proverbial ostrich which on
perceiving danger hides its head in the sand. <em>The
“Love” of mysticism is the Fear of death.</em></p>

THE SUBCONSCIOUS<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></h2>


<p>Man’s nerve cell organization may be classified
into two main systems:</p>

<p><span class="lsp">(I)</span> The inferior, the reflex, the instinctive, the
automatic centers.</p>

<p><span class="lsp">(II)</span> The superior, the controlling, selective, and
inhibitory brain-centers of the cortex.</p>

<p>The double systems of nerve-centers have correspondingly
a double mental activity, or double-consciousness
as it is sometimes called, the inferior, the
organic, the instinctive, the automatic, the reflex
consciousness, or briefly termed the <em>subconsciousness</em>,
consciousness below the threshold of self-consciousness;
and the superior, the choosing, the willing,
the critical, the <em>will-consciousness</em>. This controlling
will-consciousness may also be characterized
as the guardian-consciousness of the individual.</p>

<p>From an evolutionary standpoint, we can well
realize the biological function or importance of this
guardian-consciousness. The external world bombards
the living organism with innumerable stimuli.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
From all sides thousands of impressions come crowding
upon the senses of the individual. Each neuron
system with its appropriate receptors has its corresponding
system of reactions which, if not modified
or counteracted, may end in some harmful or fatal
result.</p>

<p>It is not of advantage to an individual of a
complex organization to respond with reaction to
all impressions coming from the external environment.
Hence, that organism will succeed best in
the struggle for existence that possesses some selective,
critical, inhibitory “choice and will” centers.
The more organized and the more sensitive and delicate
those centers are, the better will the organism
succeed in its life existence.</p>

<p>The guardian-consciousness wards off, so far as it
is possible, the harmful blows given by the stimuli
of the external environment. In man, this same
guardian consciousness keeps on constructing, by a
series of elimination and selection, a new environment,
individual and social, which leads to an ever
higher and more perfect development and realization
of the inner powers of individuality and personality.</p>

<p>Under normal conditions man’s superior and inferior
centers with their corresponding upper, critical,
controlling consciousness together with the
inferior automatic, reflex centers and their concomitant
subconscious consciousness, keep on functioning
in full harmony. The upper and lower consciousness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
form one organic unity,&mdash;one conscious, active personality.</p>

<p>Under certain abnormal conditions, however, the
two systems of nerve-centers with their corresponding
mental activities may become dissociated. The
superior nerve-centers with their critical, controlling
consciousness may become inhibited, split off from
the rest of the nervous system. The reflex, automatic,
instinctive, subconscious centers with their
mental functions are laid bare, thus becoming
directly accessible to the stimuli of the outside
world; they fall a prey to the influences of external
surroundings, influences termed <em>suggestions</em>.</p>

<p>The critical, controlling, guardian-consciousness,
being cut off and absent, the reduced individuality
lacks the rational guidance and orientation given
by the upper choice- and will-centers, and becomes
the helpless plaything of all sorts of suggestions,
sinking into the <em>trance states of the subconscious.
It is this subconscious that forms the highway of
suggestions.</em> Suggestibility is the essential characteristic
of the subconscious.</p>

<p>The subconscious rises to the surface of consciousness,
so to say, whenever there is a weakening, paralysis,
or inhibition of the upper, controlling will
and choice-centers. In other words, whenever there
is a disaggregation of the superior from the inferior
nerve-centers, there follows an increase of ideo-sensory,
ideo-motor, sensori-secretory, reflex excitability;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
and ideationally, or rationally there is present
an abnormal intensity of suggestibility.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

THE CONDITIONS AND LAWS OF SUGGESTION</h2>


<p>In order to bring to the fore subconscious activities
with their reflex, automatic psycho-motor reactions
by removal of the upper consciousness I have
found requisite, in my investigations, the following
conditions:</p>

<p><em>Normal Suggestibility,&mdash;Suggestibility in the
Normal, Waking State.</em></p>

<p>(1) Fixation of the Attention.</p>

<p>(2) Distraction of the Attention.</p>

<p>(3) Monotony.</p>

<p>(4) Limitation of Voluntary Activity.</p>

<p>(5) Limitation of the Field of Consciousness.</p>

<p>(6) Inhibition.</p>

<p>(7) Immediate Execution of the Suggestion.</p>

<p><em>Abnormal Suggestibility,&mdash;Suggestibility in Hypnotic
and Trance States</em>:</p>

<p>(1) Fixation of the Attention.</p>

<p>(2) Monotony.</p>

<p>(3) Limitation of Voluntary Activity.</p>

<p>(4) Limitation of the Field of Consciousness.</p>

<p>(5) Inhibition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>The nature of abnormal suggestibility, the result
of my investigations, is a disaggregation of consciousness,
a cleavage of the mind, a cleft that may
become ever deeper and wider, ending in a total disjunction
of the waking, guiding, controlling guardian-consciousness
from the automatic, reflex, subconscious
consciousness....</p>

<p>Normal suggestibility is of like nature,&mdash;it is a
cleft in the mind. Only here the cleft is not so deep,
not so lasting as in hypnosis or in the other subconscious
trance states. The split is but momentary.
The mental cleavage, or the psycho-physiological
disaggregation of the superior from the inferior centers
with their concomitant psychic activities is
evanescent, fleeting, often disappearing at the moment
of its appearance.</p>

<p>The following laws of suggestibility were formulated
by me:</p>

<p>I. <em>Normal suggestibility varies as indirect suggestion
and inversely as direct suggestion.</em></p>

<p>II. <em>Abnormal suggestibility varies as direct suggestion
and inversely as indirect suggestion.</em></p>

<p>A comparison of the conditions of normal and abnormal
suggestibility is valuable, since it reveals the
nature of suggestibility, and discloses its fundamental
law. An examination of the two sets of conditions
shows that in abnormal suggestibility two
conditions, distraction of attention and immediate
execution are absent, otherwise the conditions are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the same. This sameness of conditions clearly indicates
the fact that both normal and abnormal suggestibility
flow from some one common source, that
they are of like nature, and due to similar causes.</p>

<p>Now a previous study led us to the conclusion that
the nature of abnormal suggestibility is a disaggregation
of consciousness, a slit produced in the mind,
a crack that may become wider and deeper, ending in
a total disjunction of the waking, guiding, controlling
consciousness from the reflex consciousness. Normal
suggestibility is of a like nature. It is a cleft
in the mind. The cleft is not so deep, not so lasting
as it is in hypnosis, or in the state of abnormal suggestibility.
The split is but momentary, disappearing
almost at the very moment of its appearance.</p>

<p>This fleeting, evanescent character of the split
explains why suggestion in the normal state, why
normal suggestibility requires immediate execution
as one of its indispensable conditions. We must take
the opportunity of the momentary ebb of the controlling
consciousness and hastily plant our suggestion
in the soil of reflex consciousness. We must
watch for this favorable moment, not let it slip by,
otherwise the suggestion is a failure. Furthermore,
we must be careful to keep in abeyance, for the moment,
the ever active waves of the controlling consciousness.
We must find for them work in some
other direction, we must divert, we must distract
them. That is why normal suggestibility requires<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
the additional conditions of distraction and immediate
execution. For in the waking state the waking,
controlling consciousness is always on its guard, and
when enticed away, leaves its ground only for a
moment.</p>

<p>In normal suggestibility the psychic split is but
faint; the lesion, effected in the body consciousness,
is superficial, transitory, fleeting. In abnormal suggestibility,
on the contrary, the slit is deep and lasting,&mdash;it
is a severe gash. In both cases, however,
we have a removal, a dissociation of the waking from
the subwaking, reflex consciousness, suggestion becoming
effected only through the latter. For suggestibility
is the attribute of the subwaking, reflex
consciousness.</p>

<p>A comparison of the two laws discloses the same
relation. The two laws are the reverse of each other,
thus clearly indicating the presence of a controlling,
inhibiting, conscious element in one case, and its
absence in the other. In the normal state we must
guard against the inhibitory, waking consciousness,
and we have to make our suggestion as indirect as
possible. In the abnormal state, on the contrary,
no circumspection is needed; the controlling, inhibitory,
waking consciousness is more or less absent.
The subwaking, reflex consciousness is exposed to
external stimuli, and our suggestions are therefore
the more effective, the more direct we make them.</p>

<p>Suggestibility is a function of disaggregation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
consciousness, a disaggregation in which the subwaking,
reflex consciousness enters into direct communication
with the external world. The general
law of suggestibility is:</p>

<p><em>Suggestibility varies as the amount of disaggregation,
and inversely as the unification of consciousness.</em></p>

<br />
IS THE SUBCONSCIOUS A PERSONALITY?</h2>


<p>The problem that interested me most was to come
into close contact with the subwaking self. What is
its fundamental nature? What are the main traits
of its character? Since in hypnosis the subwaking
self is freed from its chains, is untrammeled by the
shackles of the upper, controlling self, since in hypnosis
the underground self is more or less exposed
to our view, it is plain that experimentation on the
hypnotic self will introduce us into the secret life of
the subwaking self. For, as we pointed out, the two
are identical.</p>

<p>I have made all kinds of experiments, bringing
subjects into catalepsy, somnambulism, giving illusions,
hallucinations, post-hypnotic suggestions, etc.
As a result of my work one central truth stands out
clear, and that is the <em>extraordinary plasticity of the
subwaking self</em>.</p>

<p>If you can only in some way or other succeed in
separating the primary controlling consciousness
from the lower one, the waking from the subwaking
self, so that they should no longer keep company,
you can do anything you please with the subwaking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
self. You can make its legs, its hands, any limb
you like perfectly rigid; you can make it eat pepper
for sugar; you can make it drink water for wine;
feel cold or warm; hear delightful stories in the absence
of all sounds; feel pain or pleasure, see oranges
where there is nothing; you can make it eat them and
enjoy their taste. In short, you can do with the
subwaking self anything you like. The subwaking
consciousness is in your power, like clay in the hands
of the potter. The plasticity of the subconscious is
revealed by its extreme suggestibility.</p>

<p>I wanted to get an insight into the very nature of
the subwaking self; I wished to make a personal
acquaintance with it. “What is its <em>personal</em> character?”
I asked. How surprised I was when, after a
close interrogation, the answer came to me that there
cannot possibly be any personal acquaintance with
it,&mdash;for <em>the subwaking self lacks personality</em>.</p>

<p>Under certain conditions a cleavage may occur
between the two selves, and then the subwaking self
may rapidly grow, develop, and attain, apparently,
the plane of self-consciousness, get crystallized into
a person, and give itself a name, imaginary, or borrowed
from history. This accounts for the spiritualistic
phenomena of personality, guides, controls, and
communications by dead personalities, or spirits
coming from another world, such as have been observed
in the case of Mrs. Piper and other mediums
of like types; it accounts for all the phenomena of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
multiple personality, simulating the dead or the living,
or formed anew out of the matrix of the subconscious.</p>

<p>All such personality metamorphoses can be easily
developed, under favorable conditions in any psychopathological
laboratory. They can be easily formed,
by suggestion in trance, hypnotic, and waking states.
The newly crystallized personality is, as a rule, extremely
unstable, ephemeral, shadowy in its outlines,
spirit-like, ghost-like, tends to become amorphous,
being formed again and again under the influence of
favorable conditions and suggestions, rising to the
surface of consciousness, then sinking into the subconsciousness,
and disappearing, only to give rise to
new personality-metamorphoses, bursting like so
many bubbles on the surface of the upper stream of
consciousness.</p>

<p>There are cases when the personality of the individual
is changed, or more personalities are formed.
This metamorphosis may be brought about <em>artificially</em>,
by suggestion, either direct or indirect.
This is often brought about in a state of hypnosis
when any number of personalities may be formed at
the will of the hypnotizer who may create them deliberately;
or they may become formed by subtle
indirect suggestion, coming from the hypnotizer, of
which he himself is not fully conscious; or the personalities
may be formed by auto-suggestions. Such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
phenomena may be regarded as the <em>artefacts of
Psychopathology</em>.</p>

<p>There are again cases which are no play-personalities
depending on hypnotic suggestion, or suggestion
in waking life, but which are really due to pathological
agencies. The former, due to suggestion,
are <em>suggestion-personalities</em>, the latter, due to pathological
agencies, are <em>pathological personalities</em>.
The formation of multiple personality by means of
suggestion does not belong to our present subject.</p>

<p>I have discussed these facts of suggestion personalities
in my volume, “The Psychology of Suggestion,”
and other works. The pathological multiple
personalities are of immense interest from many
standpoints which we need not go into just at
present, since our object is rather the causation,
not the nature and character of the personalities
themselves.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p>The subwaking self is extremely credulous; it
lacks all sense of the true and rational. “Two and
two make five.” “Yes.” Anything is accepted, if
sufficiently emphasized by the hypnotizer. The suggestibility
and imitativeness of the subwaking self
were discussed by me at great length. What I
should like to point out here is the extreme <em>servility</em>
and <em>cowardliness</em> of that self. Show hesitation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
it will show fight; command authoritatively, and it
will obey slavishly.</p>

<p><em>The subwaking self is devoid of all morality.</em> It
will steal without the least scruple; it will poison; it
will stab; it will assassinate its best friends unhesitatingly.
When completely cut off from the
waking person, it is precluded from conscience.</p>

<br />
THE CHARACTER OF THE HYPNOIDAL STATE</h2>


<p>In “The Psychology of Suggestion,” I pointed
out the conditions of normal and abnormal suggestibility.
Among these conditions, monotony and the
limitation of voluntary movements play an important
rôle. Any arrangement of external circumstances,
tending to produce monotony and limitation
of voluntary movements, brings about a subconscious
state of suggestibility in which the patient’s
mental life can be influenced with ease.</p>

<p>I find that in the subconscious hypnoidal state
consciousness is vague and memory is diffused, so
that experiences apparently forgotten come in bits
and scraps to the foreground of consciousness.
Emotional excitement is calmed, voluntary activity
is somewhat passive, and suggestions meet with little
resistance.</p>

<p>The induced subconscious hypnoidal state is a rest
state, a state of physical and mental relaxation. It
is a state of rest and relaxation that is specially
amenable to psychotherapeutic influences. The important
results obtained by me led to a closer study<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of what I then thought was a peculiar mental state
designated by me as the <em>subwaking</em>, or the <em>hypnoidal</em>
state.</p>

<p>The subwaking, or the hypnoidal state is essentially
an intermediary state belonging apparently to
the borderland of mental life. On the one hand, the
hypnoidal state touches on the waking condition;
on the other it merges into sleep and hypnosis. <em>A
close study of the hypnoidal state shows that it differs
from the hypnotic state proper and that it can
by no means be identified with light hypnosis.</em></p>

<p>In my years of work on patients and subjects, I
have observed the presence of the hypnoidal state
before the development of hypnosis and also before
the onset of sleep. When again the hypnotic or
sleep state passes into waking, the hypnoidal state
reappears. The hypnoidal state then may be regarded
as an intermediate and transitional state.</p>

<p>A somewhat related state has been long known in
psychological literature as the hypnagogic state
which precedes the oncome of sleep and is rich in
hallucinations known under the term of <em>hypnagogic</em>
hallucinations. In coming out of sleep, a closely
related state may be observed, a state which I have
termed <em>hypnapagogic</em>. In both states, hypnagogic
and hypnapagogic, dream-hallucinations hold sway.</p>

<p>The hypnagogic and hypnapagogic states do not
belong to light hypnosis, as it can hardly be claimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
that men fall into light hypnosis twice, or possibly
more than that, every day of their life. We do not go
into light hypnosis with every nap we take. We do,
however, go into the hypnoidal state when we pass
into sleep or come out of sleep. Every drowsy state
has the hypnoidal state as one of its constituents;
every sleep state is preceded and followed by the
hypnoidal state.</p>

<p>Hypnosis may be regarded as belonging to the
abnormal mental states, while the hypnoidal state is
more closely allied to waking and sleep, and belongs
to the normal, physiological, mental states. At first,
I regarded the hypnoidal state as peculiar, but as I
proceeded with my observations and experiments I
could not help coming to the conclusion that the
hypnoidal state is found in all the representatives
of animal life and is as normal as waking and sleep.</p>

<p>The hypnoidal state may be said to partake not
only of the nature of waking and sleep, but also to
possess some characteristics of hypnosis, namely,
<em>suggestibility</em>. It is clear that, from the very nature
of its mixed symptomatology, the hypnoidal state is
variable and highly unstable. The hypnoidal state
may be regarded in the light of an equivalent of sleep.
Like sleep, the hypnoidal state has many levels of
depth. It differs, however, from sleep in the rapidity
of oscillation from level to level.</p>

<p>In the experiments of various investigators, the
depth of sleep is found to be represented by a rapidly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
rising curve during the first couple of hours, and
by a gradually descending curve during the rest of
the hours of sleep. No such regularity of curve can
be found in the hypnoidal state. The depth of the
hypnoidal state changes very rapidly, and with it
the passive condition and suggestibility of the
patient.</p>

<p>For many years investigations of the hypnoidal
state were carried out by me on subjects and patients,
adults, and children. The work was entirely
limited to the study of such states as found in man.
Having found that during the hypnoidal state the
condition of suggestibility is quite pronounced for
therapeutic purposes, and having effected many
cures of severe psychopathic maladies ranging
throughout the whole domain of hysterical affections,
neurasthenia, obsessions, drug habits, especially
alcoholic ones, the hypnoidal state has become,
in my practice, quite an important therapeutic
agent. Other investigators have obtained some excellent
results with the hypnoidal state in their treatment
of various functional, psychopathic maladies.</p>

<p>Thus far, the work with the hypnoidal state has
been confined entirely to observations and experiments
on human subjects and patients, and also to
the treatment of man’s psychopathic ailments. I
undertook a series of experiments on sleep, both
from a phylogenetic and ontogenetic standpoint, following
up the conditions and manifestations of sleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
in the ascending scale of animal life, from the frog
and the guinea pig, through the cat, the dog, to the
infant and the adult.</p>

<p>My experiments clearly prove that the hypnoidal
state is by no means confined to man, but is also
present in animals. This is important since it indubitably
shows how widely spread the hypnoidal
state is throughout the domain of animal life. Moreover,
the experiments clearly prove that the further
down we descend in the scale of animal organization,
the more prominent, the more essential, does the hypnoidal
state become.</p>

<p>The conclusion is forced upon me that <em>the hypnoidal
state is the primitive rest-state out of which
sleep has arisen in the later stages of evolution. We
may say that sleep and hypnosis take their origin in
the hypnoidal state</em>.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> Sleep and hypnosis are highly
differentiated states; they have evolved out of the
primitive, undifferentiated, hypnoidal state which is
essentially a subwaking rest-state characteristic of
early and lowly-organized animal life. <em>The hypnoidal
state is the primordial sleep state.</em></p>

<p>The development of the hypnoidal state into sleep
has proven itself useful in the struggle for existence
of the higher animals; it has, therefore, become fixed
as the rest-state, characteristic of the higher representatives
of animal life. Hypnosis and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
trance-states, variations of the primitive hypnoidal
rest-state, have become eliminated as useless and possibly
harmful to the normal life adjustments of the
higher animals and can only be induced under artificial
conditions in but a fraction of the human race.</p>

<p>The hypnoidal state is the normal rest-state of the
lower vertebrates and invertebrates. The rest or
sleep state of the lower animals is a sort of passive
waking state,&mdash;a subwaking state which has survived
in man as the hypnoidal state. Of course, the
state has been largely modified in man by the course
of evolution, but it can still be clearly detected, just
as the tail of the simian can be discerned in the
human coccyx, or as the structure of the prehensile
hand of the quadrumana can be still clearly traced
in the foot of man. Waking, hypnoidal, and sleep-states
may be termed <em>normal</em> states, while <em>hypnosis</em>
and various other trance-states may be termed <em>sub-normal</em>
states.</p>

<p>The relation of the hypnoidal state to waking,
sleep, hypnosis, and other subconscious states may
be represented by the diagram on <a href="#DIAG_2">following page.</a></p>

<p>The hypnoidal state is normal, it is present in all
representatives of animal life.</p>

<p>Sleep, hypnosis, and trance-states are variations
of the fundamental hypnoidal state. The sleep-state
has proven useful and has become normal in the
higher animals, while hypnosis like animal “cataplexy”
and the various forms of trance-states, likewise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
variations of the fundamental hypnoidal state,
characteristic of man, have not proven of vital value,
and have fallen below the normal stream of consciousness
with its concomitant adaptive reactions.</p>

<p>The hypnoidal state is brief, variable, and unstable.
They who have observed the rest-states of
the lower metazoa can form a clear idea of the nature
as well as of the biological significance of the hypnoidal
state in the life of the lower animals. The
animal is at rest for a brief period of time as long
as it remains undisturbed by external conditions of
its environment, or by internal conditions, such as
hunger, sexual impulses, or other internal disturbances.
Soon the animal begins to move, sluggishly
at first, and then more quickly, and if there are no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
disturbing stimulations, comes to rest, to be again
disturbed from its rest-equilibrium by the varying
conditions of its environment.</p>

<p>The resting state is brief, irregular, differing from
the waking state in but slight relaxation, in comparatively
slow reactions to stimulations, and in a
passive condition of the muscular system. Respiration
is regular, and diminished in rate. The heart
beat is slightly decreased, and general katabolic
activity is somewhat reduced.</p>

<p>The animal, however, is quite alive to what is
going on. <em>The animal rests, watching for danger.</em></p>

<p>Resting and active states alternate periodically,
if possible, but usually are irregular. The resting
state is but a passive condition in which the animal
may be considered to hover between waking and
what we describe in the case of the higher animals as
sleep. Sleep, in its proper sense, does not exist
among the lower representatives of animal life.</p>

<p>This state of hovering between waking and sleeping,
the characteristic of the hypnoidal state, is no
doubt of paramount importance in the life-existence
of the lower animals, considering the numerous dangers
to which they are continually exposed. The
animal must always be on the watch, either for food
or for foe. It can only rest or “sleep” with its eyes
wide open. The hypnoidal “sleep” can be best characterized
as a <em>subwaking</em>, “twilight” rest-state.</p>

<p>I demonstrated in my experiments that the animal,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
while in the hypnoidal, subwaking rest-state, is
apt to fall into a cataleptic state, especially when
the movements are suddenly and forcibly inhibited.
This cataleptic state, which reminds one of the hypnotic
state, may be observed in the lower animals,
such as the frog, the snake, the lobster, the bird, and,
to a slighter degree, even in the higher animals, such
as the guinea pig, the cat, the dog, especially in the
young ones, such as the kitten, the puppy, and the
infant.</p>

<p>There is little doubt that the cataleptic state into
which animals fall during the hypnoidal rest-state is
of some protective value in their life. The animal
“freezes,” “feigns death,” and is thus either enabled
to remain undetected by the animal on which it feeds
or, what is still more important, is enabled to remain
unnoticed by its enemy and thus escape certain
death. The subwaking, hypnoidal state may be regarded
as the fundamental rest-state of lower animals,
and is characterized by a mixed symptomatology
of waking, sleep, and hypnosis.</p>

<p>The hypnoidal state is a powerful instrument in
the tracing of the past history of the growth and
development of the symptoms of psychopathic or
neurotic cases; and practically is of far greater
value, inasmuch as the hypnoidal state has proven
to be an easy agency in effecting a cure, and bringing
about beneficial results in otherwise uncontrollable
cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>For the present, we can only say that the hypnoidal
state is found in man but in a rudimentary
condition. It is a vestige of man’s primitive, animal
ancestors. The hypnoidal state is brief, variable,
forming the entrance and exit of repose,&mdash;the portals
of sleep. The primordial rest-state has shrunk
to a transitory, momentary stage in the alternation
of waking and sleep. <em>The subwaking, hypnoidal
rest-state shrinks with the increase of security of
life.</em></p>

HYPNOIDAL PSYCHOTHERAPY</h2>


<p>Once the hypnoidal state is induced by any of the
various methods of hypnoidization, we can either
attempt to follow up the history of the development
of the malady, or we may chiefly work for therapeutic
effects. It is, however, advisable, from a
purely practical, therapeutic purpose to combine
the two procedures; the cure is then effective and
far more stable. When the history of the origin
and development of the disease can not be traced,
on account of the age or unintelligence of the patient,
the therapeutic effects alone of the hypnoidal states
have been utilized.</p>

<p>The getting access to subconscious experiences,
lost to the patient’s personal consciousness, makes
the hypnoidal state a valuable instrument in the
tracing of the origin and development of the symptoms
of the psychopathic malady.</p>

<p>From a practical standpoint, however, the therapeutic
value of the hypnoidal state is most important.
Our experiments have revealed to us the significant
fact that the hypnoidal state is the primordial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
rest-state; sleep is but a derivative form. In
many conditions of disease it is advisable to have
the patient revert to a simple and primitive mode of
life. Similarly, in <em>psychopathic diseases a reversion
to a simple, primitive state proves to be of material
help to the patient</em>.</p>

<p>In plunging the patient into the hypnoidal state,
we have him revert to a primitive rest-state with its
consequent beneficial results. The suggestibility of
the state, if skillfully handled, is apt to increase the
therapeutic efficacy. <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Relaxtion of nervous'">Relaxation of nervous</ins> strain,
rest from worry, abatement of emotional excitement
are known to be of great help in the treatment of
nervous troubles of the neurasthenic, or of the so-called
“psychoasthenic” variety. That is what we
precisely observe in the treatment of psychopathic
or neurotic diseases by means of the agency of the
hypnoidal state, the efficacy of which is all the
greater on account of the presence of the important
trait of suggestibility.</p>

<p>The most important fact, however, is <em>the access
gained through the hypnoidal state to the patient’s
stores of subconscious reserve neuron energy, thus
helping to bring about an association of disintegrated,
dissociated mental-systems</em>.</p>

<p>Dr. John Donley in his article, “The Clinical Use
of Hypnoidization” (<cite>Journal of Abnormal Psychology
for August-September, 1908</cite>), gives the following
account of the method of hypnoidization:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The treatment of that large group of disorders,
forgotten memories, and emotions is operative in
the production of mental disaggregation, but also
in those numerous instances where the experience
causing the obsessive idea or emotion is well known
to the upper consciousness.</p>

<p>“In hypnoidal states they were made to reproduce
their obsessive thoughts and images and then to
describe them in words. When this had been accomplished
and they had received further assurance and
persuasion from the experimenter, although the
purely intellectual content of their obsessions remained
known to them, the insistent automatic character
and disturbing emotional factors had disappeared.
In this metamorphosis of emotional reaction
we may observe one of the most interesting and useful
attributes of the hypnoidal state.”</p></div>

<p>Dr. Donley gives a series of cases which he treated
successfully from psychognostic and psychotherapeutic
standpoints. The reader is referred to the
original article.</p>

<p>“The value of hypnoidization,” says Dr. T. W.
Mitchell, “in the resurrection of dissociated memories
is that which is perhaps best established. And
this applies not only to the restoration of the forgotten
experiences of ordinary amnesia, but to the
recovery of dissociated memories that are of pathogenic
significance.... Sidis himself has insistently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
taught that the reassociation of dissociated complexes
effects a cure of psychopathic disease....
My own experience, so far as it goes, tends to corroborate
in every respect the claims put forward by
Sidis....”</p>

<p>While in the hypnoidal state the patient hovers
between the conscious and the subconscious, somewhat
in the same way as in the half-drowsy condition
one hovers between wakefulness and sleep. The
patient keeps on fluctuating from moment to
moment, now falling more deeply into a subconscious
condition in which outlived experiences are easily
aroused, and again rising to the level of the waking
state. Experiences long submerged and forgotten
rise to the full light of consciousness. They come
in bits, in chips, in fragments, which may gradually
coalesce and form a connected series of interrelated
systems of experiences apparently long dead and
buried. The resurrected experiences then stand out
clear and distinct in the patient’s mind. The recognition
is fresh, vivid, and instinct with life, as if the
experiences had occurred the day before.</p>

<p>It cannot be insisted too much that the hypnoidal
state is not a slight hypnosis. <em>The hypnoidal state
is a light sleep state, a twilight state.</em> The hypnoidal
state is the anabolic state of repose, characteristic
of primitive life.</p>

<p>The hypnoidal state is an intermediary state between
waking and sleep. <em>Subwaking</em> is an appropriate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
descriptive term of the character of the hypnoidal
state.</p>

<p>The subwaking hypnoidal state, like sleep and
hypnosis, may be of various depth and duration; it
may range from the fully waking consciousness and
again may closely approach and even merge into
sleep or hypnosis. The same patient may at various
times reach different levels, and hence subconscious
experiences which are inaccessible at one time may
become revealed at some subsequent time, when the
patient happens to go into a deeper hypnoidal state.</p>

<p>On account of the instability of the hypnoidal
state, and because of the continuous fluctuation and
variation of its depth, the subconscious dissociated
experiences come up in bits and scraps, and often
may lack the sense of familiarity and recognition.
The patient often loses the train of subconscious
association. There is a constant struggle to maintain
this highly unstable hypnoidal state.</p>

<p>One has again and again to return to the same
subconscious train started into activity for a brief
interval of time. One must pick his way among
streams of disturbing associations before the dissociated
subconscious experiences can be synthesized
into a whole, reproducing the original experience
that has given rise to the whole train of symptoms.</p>

<p>The hypnoidal state may sometimes reproduce the
original experience which, at first struggling up in a
broken, distorted form, and finally becoming synthesized,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
produces a full attack. The symptoms of
the malady turn out to be portions, bits and chips
of past experiences which have become dissociated,
giving rise to a disaggregated subconsciousness.</p>

<p>The method of hypnoidization, and the hypnoidal
states induced by it, enable us to trace the history
and etiology of the symptoms, and also to effect a
synthesis and a cure. The hypnoidal state may
not be striking and sensational in its manifestations,
but it is a powerful instrument in psychopathology
and psychotherapeutics.</p>

<p>For many years my investigations of the hypnoidal
state were carried out on subjects and patients,
adults and children. Having found that during
the hypnoidal state the condition of mental plasticity
is quite pronounced for therapeutic purposes,
and having effected many cures of severe psychopathic
maladies, ranging throughout the whole domain
of so-called hysterical affections, neurasthenia,
obsessions, drug habits, especially alcoholic ones, the
hypnoidal state has become in my practice quite an
important therapeutic agent. Lately, others have
obtained excellent results with the hypnoidal state
in their treatment of various functional, psychopathic
or neurotic maladies.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may be opportune here for the sake
of further elucidation to give a few extracts from
the Presidential address on “The Hypnoidal State<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
of Sidis,” given by Dr. T. W. Mitchell before the
Psycho-Medical Society of Great Britain, January
26, 1911.</p>

<p>“The history of science,” says Dr. Mitchell in his
address, “affords us many instances in which the
neglect of residual phenomena in experimental research
has led to the overlooking of important facts,
and prevented investigators from making discoveries
which, had they paid attention to their residues, they
could hardly have missed. The great chemist, Cavendish,
probably missed the discovery of argon,
because in his estimate of nitrogen of the air he neglected
a residue which his experiments showed him
could not be more than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>120</sub> part of the whole.
More than a hundred years afterwards this residue
was accounted for by the discovery of argon.</p>

<p>“Now in the history of Psychotherapeutics, from
its earliest beginning down to our own time, we find
many cases where the circumstances under which
curative results have been obtained render it difficult
for us to range these results under the category
of the therapeutics of suggestion.</p>

<p>“Such cases as these may be regarded as the residual
phenomena of the therapeutics of suggestion,
and just as Cavendish and his successors too readily
assumed that all the so-called nitrogen of the air was
the same as the nitrogen of nitre, so we may be missing
some important truth, if we too readily assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
that all these therapeutic results are due solely to
suggestion. The value of suggestion during hypnosis
is well attested, and the possibility of effecting
physiological and psychological changes by its means
is supported by a large amount of experimental evidence.
But evidence of this kind is lacking in regard
to suggestion without hypnosis, and until it is forthcoming,
we are justified in receiving with some suspicion
the account of the therapeutic efficacy of suggestion
in the waking state. We seem bound to consider
whether some state of consciousness intermediate
between waking and hypnosis may not be
artificially induced and utilized for the purpose of
giving therapeutic suggestion.</p>

<p>“The scientific investigation of states of consciousness
intermediate between waking and hypnosis
is a contribution to psychology and psychotherapy
which we owe practically to one man&mdash;Dr.
Sidis. A research into the nature of suggestibility
led him to formulate certain laws and conditions of
normal and abnormal suggestibility....</p>

<p>“By keeping the patient for a short time under
the conditions of normal suggestibility we induce a
peculiar mental state which Sidis named <em>Hypnoidal
state</em>. The process by which it is induced is what
Sidis calls, <em>hypnoidization</em>.</p>

<p>“By the use of various methods a state of consciousness
is induced which differs from full waking,
but is not hypnosis or ordinary sleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“The hypnoidal state is an intermediary territory,
on the borderland of waking, sleep and hypnosis. In
the course of a valuable experimental investigation
of sleep in man and the lower animals, Sidis discovered
that the hypnoidal state is a phase of consciousness
which is passed through in every transition from
one of these states to another. In passing from the
waking state to ordinary sleep or hypnosis, there is
always a longer or shorter hypnoidal stage. In the
practice of hypnoidization the patient sometimes
drops into hypnosis, or he may fall asleep without
touching on hypnosis. And so also in awaking from
sleep or from hypnosis, the hypnoidal state has to
be passed through. Sidis found that the further we
descend in the scale of animal life, the more important
does the hypnoidal state become in relation to
bodily rest and recuperation, and he concludes that
it is the primitive rest-state out of which both sleep
and hypnosis have been evolved.</p>

<p>“The relation to each other of waking, sleep, hypnosis
and the hypnoidal state, may be represented in
a diagram in which the primitive hypnoidal state is
represented as a nucleus from which the segments
of the larger circle, waking, sleep and hypnosis, have
arisen. The transition from one of these segments
to another can take place through the central territory
with which they each have relations. (See diagram
on <a href="#DIAG_3">page 110.</a>)</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“The spontaneous occurrence of the hypnoidal
state in man is as a rule merely a transitory stage
in the alternation of waking and sleep. From the
point of view of evolution it is a vestige derived from
a long race of ancestors, a rudimentary function
which has been superseded by the more highly specialized
rest-state, sleep. But it can be artificially
induced and maintained by the methods which have
been described, and it can be utilized with effect in
the treatment of psychopathic disorders.</p>

<p>“The therapeutic use of the hypnoidal state is a
somewhat complex subject, for hypnoidization may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
be employed as an adjunct to other methods or as
a curative measure in itself.</p>

<p>“The full record of hypnoidization is in the
account of the well known Hanna case, given in his
‘Multiple Personality.’ This was a case of total
amnesia, following a severe injury to the head.
The patient, a cultured clergyman, was reduced to
the mental condition of a new-born child. All his
former acquisitions and memories had entirely disappeared,
and he had to start learning everything
again from the beginning. When he (the patient)
was put into the hypnoidal state various fragmentary
experiences of his past life emerged into consciousness,
demonstrating to his observers that his
lost memories were merely dissociated and not destroyed.
This same method (hypnoidization) was
made use of in other cases of amnesia, and it was
found to be of great assistance in effecting the resurrection
of dissociated mental material and its reintegration
in consciousness.</p>

<p>“With the progress of his studies in Psychopathology,
the reintegration of consciousness became, for
Sidis, the aim of all therapeutic endeavor in connection
with maladies that are associated with, or produced
by, mental dissociation. The recurrent psycho-motor
states of functional psychosis, insistent
ideas, imperative concepts, persistent, or periodically
appearing emotional states, so-called psychic
epilepsy, and other states of dissociation all lent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
themselves to treatment by hypnoidization. By its
means the dissociated complexes could be recovered,
the psychogenesis of the malady could be traced, a
synthesis of consciousness effected, and the patient
thereby cured. As his confidence in his method
increased, Sidis gradually extended its employment,
until at the present time he seems to use it in every
kind of disorder in which psychotherapy is indicated.</p>

<p>“I have no doubt that Dr. Bramwell induces in
his patients a state of consciousness which is identical
with the hypnoidal state of Sidis.</p>

<p>“My own experience, so far as it goes, tends to
corroborate in every respect the therapeutic claims
put forward by Sidis. I have observed the good
effects of the hypnoidal state apart from any other
measure.</p>

<p>“In his later writings Sidis insistently maintains
that the use of hypnoidization alone is sufficient to
cure certain morbid conditions. He bases this claim
on the fact that he has found the hypnoidal state
effective towards this end, and he interprets his
results as being due to a release of reserve energy
which has been locked up in the inhibited and dissociated
systems or complexes.</p>

<p>“The <em>principle of reserve energy</em> is based upon a
wide generalization of facts, namely, that far less
energy is utilized by the individual than is actually
at his disposal. In the struggle for existence, those<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
forms of life which have accumulated a store of
reserve energy that can be drawn upon in emergencies
have the best chance for survival.”</p>

<p>According to my experimental and clinical work
the waking state, sleep, hypnosis, and the hypnoidal
state, may be differentiated as follows:</p>

<p><span class="lsp">(I)</span> In the waking state the upper, controlling
consciousness <em>predominates</em> over the subconscious.
In other words, in the waking state the conscious is
more responsive and more active than the subconscious
which as a rule under such conditions may be
regarded as partially dormant.</p>

<p><span class="lsp">(II)</span> In sleep <em>both</em> the conscious and the subconscious
are <em>reduced</em> in activity, often even <em>inhibited</em>
in function. Motor consciousness is <em>arrested</em>; motor
control is paralyzed. The personality is <em>disintegrated</em>.</p>

<p><span class="lsp">(III)</span> In hypnosis the upper, controlling consciousness
is <em>diminished</em> in activity, while the subconscious
activities are <em>increased</em> in extensity and intensity.
In hypnosis the relationship of the conscious
and subconscious is interchanged,&mdash;the conscious
becomes subconscious, and <em>vice versa</em>. The habitual
type of character may become changed by suggestion,
giving rise to double and multiple personality,
according <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'to the crystillization'">to the crystallization</ins> of various association
systems, while the habitual, critical attitude is
reduced in intensity.</p>

<p><span class="lsp">(IV)</span> In the hypnoidal state both conscious and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
subconscious functions are <em>lowered</em> in activity with no
decrease in the intensity of critical attitude, and with
<em>no change</em> of personality.</p>

<p>The hypnoidal state is therefore not a light hypnosis,
but rather a <em>light sleeping state, a twilight
state</em>. The hypnoidal state is a primitive rest-state
out of which sleep and hypnosis have arisen in the
course of animal evolution.</p>

<br />
EGOTISM AND FEAR</h2>


<p>As we have pointed out, the fear instinct is the
arousal of the impulse of self-preservation. Psychopathic
conditions are at bottom fear states interrelated
with hypnoidal states and with an abnormal,
pathological condition of the impulse of self-preservation.
This is manifested in the fundamental trait
of extreme selfishness characteristic of psychopathic
patients. The patient is entirely absorbed in himself,
and is ready to sacrifice every one to his terrors.</p>

<p>For many years, day after day and night after
night, I lived with patients who were under my care,
observation, and treatment. One trait always revealed
to me the predominant characteristic under
the constantly changing psychopathic symptom-complex
and that is <em>the extreme selfishness of the
patients</em>. There is no greater egotism to be found
than in the typical cases of psychopathic disorders.
This egotism runs parallel to the condition of the
psychopathic state. This does not mean that
every egotist is necessarily psychopathic, but <em>every
psychopathic case is essentially egotistic</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>The psychopathic patient does not hesitate a
moment to sacrifice to his “affection” father, mother,
brother, sister, husband, wife, lover, friend, and
children. In severe cases the patient stops at nothing
and only fear of suffering, sickness, evil consequences,
and punishments can restrain the patient.
In some extreme cases the patient is almost diabolical
in his selfishness.</p>

<p>The constant sympathy which the patients crave
from others, and which they demand, if it is not
given to them immediately, is but an expression of
their extreme obsession by the impulse of self-preservation.
In their struggle for self-preservation
they forget everything else, nothing is remembered
but themselves. This condition becomes the ground
character which is often expressed in a frank, brutal
way. Even in the best of patients one can find
glimpses into the depths of the psychopathic soul
which is nothing but the immense egotism of the
beast, worsted in the struggle for existence, tortured
by the agonizing pangs of the fear instinct.</p>

<p>In the vanity, conceit, arrogance, and overbearing
attitude towards others, friend or stranger, as
well as in the total indifference to the suffering of
his intimate friends and acquaintances, we once more
find the expression of that terrible selfishness which
obsesses the psychopathic patient. In order to get
rid of some small inconvenience, or to obtain some
slight pleasure, the patient will put others as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
as his “near and dear ones” not only to inconvenience,
but to permanent pain, and even torture.</p>

<p>The patient lacks confidence, at least that is what
he complains of, but he does not hesitate to demand
of his best friends and even of total strangers all the
services possible, if they are given to him, thinking
that he is fully entitled to them. The patient has
the conceit and vanity of his great worth in comparison
with other people. The world and especially his
family, physicians, attendants, friends, acquaintances,
lovers, should offer their happiness and life
for his comfort.</p>

<p>Even when the psychopathic patient does some
altruistic act, it is only in so far as he himself can
benefit by that deed. He is ready to drop it as soon
as the work does not answer his selfish purposes.
Himself first and last, that is the essence of psychopathic
life.</p>

<p>The patient is convinced of his goodness and kindness,
and of his human affections which are far superior
to those of the common run. He adores himself
and he is always ready to dwell in the glory of
his delicacy and extraordinary sensitivity. This
trait he is specially anxious to impress on his friends,
on his family, and even on those whom he apparently
loves. “I am the delicate being of whom you all,
unappreciative, gross, insensible people should take
care.” That is the principle on which the psychopathic
patient lives. The patient will do anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to attract attention to this side of his personality.
He will emphasize his sickness, exaggerate his symptoms,
and even manufacture them for the benefit of
those who dare to ignore him or who pay little attention
to his condition, to his wants, needs, caprices,
passing whims, and especially his fears, which underlie
all his wishes and desires. <em>There is nothing so
tyrannical and merciless as the autocratic, fear-obsessed
“weak” will of a psychopathic or neurotic
patient.</em></p>

<p>The patient’s whole attention is concentrated on
himself, or more specially on the symptoms of his
psychopathic malady, symptoms which obsess him
for the time being. Whatever the symptoms be, permanent
or changing, the patient’s demand is to
have others sympathize with the illness from which
he suffers, to have them realize the “fearful” agonies
which he undergoes. The selfishness of the patient
is exacting and knows no bounds. The whole world
is to serve him, and be at his command. The psychopathic
patient is driven by the impulse of self-preservation
and by the furies of the fear instinct.</p>

<p>Many of my psychopathic patients tell me that
they feel sensitive as long as they witness the sufferings
of other people, otherwise they do not care to
know anything about them. They are anxious to
have such things away from them as a nuisance.
They insist on being surrounded only with pleasant
things or with persons and objects that contribute<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
to their health and happiness. Everything is absorbed
by the worship of Moloch Health to whom
the patients sacrifice everything. Pain, suffering,
and distress of other people are looked at only from
the standpoint of the possible effect they may have
on the patient’s “precarious health.” Like Nero,
who was probably a psychopathic character, the
psychopathic patient is ready to burn others for his
health; if necessary, to torture “health and happiness”
out of his best friends.</p>

<p>One of my patients, who is highly intelligent, tells
me frankly that he uses others to squeeze out of
them strength for himself. As soon as he can no
longer get it, or has obtained all he can, he is anxious
to part with them, gets tired of them, and even begins
to be resentful because they are in the way of his
health. Another of my patients was ready to burn
parks, stables, and destroy everything, if he knew
that it was good for his health. Other patients
of mine do not hesitate to wake up the whole house
to help them in insomnia or indigestion. Many of
my patients take pleasure in forming acquaintances
and even friendship with people, ask for their sympathy,
require their help and assistance, come to
them early in the morning and late at night, disturb
their sleep in the small hours of the morning, display
all their symptoms of indigestion, nausea, eructation,
and vomiting. The patients then turn round, abuse
the person who helps them, telling him disagreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
things, because he is no longer useful. A few hours
later the patients may turn again for help to the
same person, because they find that they could still
make use of him.</p>

<p>Psychopathic patients do not hesitate, for the
alleviation of their pains, of depression, of insomnia,
to take a bath in the early morning and wake up
all the other patients. They are entirely absorbed in
themselves. Self is the only object of their regard.
A clever lawyer, aptly characterized one of my most
severe and typical psychopathic cases as “egomaniac.”
“When you talk of gravity, ‘I am gravity,’
she claims. Talk of the Trinity: ‘I am the Trinity.’”
As a matter of fact every psychopathic
patient is an egomaniac.</p>

<p>Bacon’s aphorisms about self-lovers may well
apply to psychopathic patients: “And certainly it
is in the nature of extreme self-lovers, as they will set
a house on fire, and it were but to roast their
eggs.... That which is specially to be noted is,
that those which are <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui amantes sine rivali</i>, are many
times unfortunate.”</p>

<p>Driven by the impulse of self-preservation and by
the anguish of extreme fear, the psychopathic patient
may be pitied as a most unfortunate, miserable
wretch.</p>

<p>In the psychognosis of the particular condition,
mental or nervous, be it object, idea, or action from
which the patient suffers, the impulse of self-preservation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
with its instinctive emotion of fear can
always be found in the background of consciousness
or in the subconsciousness.</p>

<p>An insight into a series of cases will help best
to understand the fundamental psychopathological
processes that give rise to the different forms of
psychoneuroses and somatopsychoses.</p>

<p>The inhibition of the patient’s activities, produced
by the most primitive impulse of self-preservation
with its instinct of fear, limits the patient’s life to
such an extent that the interests and the activities
are reduced to automatic repetition of reactions of
a stereotyped character. The stimuli must be the
same, otherwise the patient does not care to respond.
He loses interest in his business, in reading, in his
work, and games. The attention keeps on wandering.
Games, pleasures, and hobbies in which he formerly
used to take an interest lose their attraction
for him. The life he is disposed to lead is of a vegetative
existence. He is afraid of anything new.
Things are done in an automatic way. <em>Routine and
automatisms are characteristic of his activities.</em></p>

<p>The psychopathic or neurotic patient talks about
his humanitarian ideals, about his great abilities
superior to the common run of humanity, and how
with his talents he is willing and has been willing to
confer benefits on poor suffering humanity in spite
of the fact that he has to struggle with his poor
health, physical, nervous and mental. In spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
the overwhelming fatigue due to ill health, and in
spite of the fearful ideas and impulses that have
beset him day and night he still has succeeded in
fighting his way through.</p>

<p>The patient hankers for notoriety, for praise, for
appreciation by other people. He is apt to complain
that the family, neighbors, acquaintances,
friends cannot appreciate his good points, his good
will, and his high ideals to which he conforms his life,
tortured as it is with pains and suffering of poor
health. The <em>egocentric</em> character of the psychopathic
patient is bound up in his abnormally developed
impulse of self-preservation and in his pathological
state of the fear instinct.</p>

<p>Thus one patient opens his account with the
phrase: “From boyhood I had a sensitive conscience.”</p>

<p>Another patient writes: “As a child I had a
keener instinct as to the real unexpressed attitude
of those about me toward each other than the average
child.”</p>

<p>One of my patients, a puny being of mediocre
intelligence, writes: “I have always, from the earliest
childhood, felt that I was different from those
about me; and I must acknowledge that it was not
alone a feeling of inferiority on account of poor control,
but a feeling that I understood more than they.
I was, however, of a delicate constitution and suffered
from ill health.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>Psychopathic patients subscribe to the “cheerful”
effusions of “New Thought,” and plaster the walls of
their rooms with elevating “Rules for Health and
Happiness.” <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'Phychoanalysis and Christian'">Psychoanalysis and Christian</ins> Science
are the rage. The victims hide behind the veil of
sickly, psychopathic “Love.”</p>

<p>The writings and accounts of the patients are full
of introspection about health, and about the minutiae
of their feelings in the various parts of their body.
Some of the patients with a literary turn keep on
writing volumes about the most minute symptoms of
their troubles to which they happen at any moment
to be subject. I have numbers of manuscripts,
biographies, autobiographies, all telling the same old
story of “blighted lives” due to ill health, drugs,
and treatment, all describing with the over-scrupulous
exactness of microscopic anatomy the different
symptoms that plague them by night and by day.
The patients tell of their talents and remarkable
abilities, superior to the average run, of their ill luck
and failures, due to their unfortunate state of ill
health.</p>

<p>In quoting from some of the accounts given to me
by the patients themselves I wish to attract attention
to this side of the patient’s mental condition, the
expression of the impulse of self-preservation, manifested
in the general panic of health, or fear of disease,
whether nervous or physical.</p>

<p>A patient of mine, a clerk of mediocre intelligence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
with hardly any ability, but with plenty of selfishness,
introspection, and immeasurable conceit,
writes about his ideals in life:</p>

<p>“I would ask that this manuscript be considered
in connection with my other two writings. I have
already partially covered this ground in my autobiography.
I should be glad to have my general
outlook on life considered, and to receive suggestions
relative to vocations and avocations, since my
anxieties regarding these are inseparably intermingled
with my thoughts of physical and mental
health.</p>

<p>“Of course since childhood my ideals have undergone
a gradual modification. First, there was the
religious motive of life: I wanted to be a soldier
of the cross and assist in the regeneration of souls
and their preparation for the life beyond.... I
began to meditate upon ethical theories.... It
appears that in doing the world’s work the tendency
is to specialize.... In the matter of choosing my
employment my own interest is identical with the
interest of society. At different times of my life I
have fancied I had a liking for one calling or another....
My lines of thought have gradually drifted
into the philosophical (patient means the various
occult scribblings about ‘health metaphysics’). I
now ask myself why I should be a lawyer, a physician,
a minister, a philanthropist or any other special
thing? I conceive that a man’s life is largely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
what circumstances make it, and it may be, therefore,
that I shall always be a clerk in an office, trying
to be useful in a small way; but now we are talking
of influencing such matters as far as we can by
choice. I imagine that perhaps my field is in the
line of ethics, philosophy, or whatever words may be
used to signify the <em>general principles</em> governing
human affairs. My reasons for thinking so are as
follows: First, I feel a strong interest in those principles
comparing to no other interest in my life.
Second, I find very few people who seem to feel any
such interest in such matters. Third, I believe such
principles to be of supreme importance. The question
is,&mdash;Is my position in regard to general truths
so peculiar that I should regard it my mission to
give those subjects more attention in study and expression
than do other men?</p>

<p>“The question I want to settle is,&mdash;Do other men
feel this same philosophical interest, realize the
broad field of human obligation, and come down to
special occupations, not because they are more interesting
to them than the general field, but because
they realize they must specialize in order to properly
assist in carrying on the world’s work? If this be
so then I am mistaken in thinking I should give particular
attention to general principles. But my
observations have gone to show that the average
physician, lawyer, merchant or politician is not interested
in the broad questions of life, but only in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
medicine, law, business, or politics, caring little for
the relation of his vocation to other vocations except
as he makes his bread by it. Why then if the various
departments of human activity must be correlated,
and if the individuals making up those respective
departments have no disposition to do the correlating,&mdash;should
it not be done by those who are
interested in the general field?”</p>

<p>It means that such work could be and should be
done by the patient, by the philosophical clerk, interested
in the general “metaphysics” of health.</p>

<p>Such confessions can be easily elicited from
psychopathic patients even in their best states of
apparent diffidence, humility. <em>This paranoidal aspect
of self-aggrandizement is present in all psychopathic
cases.</em> In some this trait stands out more
clearly and distinctly than in others. It is, however,
present in all psychopathic patients, if one
observes them closely and attentively. It is the expression
of an intensified state of the impulse of
self-preservation and fear instinct. In other words,
it is a state of an exaggerated, hypertrophied egotism.</p>

<p>“We must appeal to a law higher than the material
law,” a patient writes in his account. “I
worried much over it. Since that time the relation
of mind and matter greatly interested me....
My health at this time failed, I lost appetite and
strength, had hysterical symptoms. I was treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
for general neurasthenia.” ... Psychopathic, philosophical
and ethical speculations and interests have
their sole source in fear of sickness and self-preservation.</p>

<p>“One of my anxieties,” another patient writes,
“of my present life is connected with my business
and my relationship to my partners. I am naturally
conscientious and inclined to be not only earnest
and sincere, but serious. My nature, instincts, and
desires are not superficial. Yet my relation to
the business is a superficial one. I am neither fitted
by natural tastes nor by training for the indoor,
rather mechanical, conventional, and routine processes
upon which business and commercial success
depends....</p>

<p>“Without the common motives of an ordinary
merchant (greed) I am placed in the position of
the one who lives not by the usual and conventional
standards of right and wrong, but rather by a
more exalted and more rigid one of his own making
which, unsupported by habit, and institutions,
requires a greater loyalty, a higher resolve, and
a firmer will than is required of the conventional
and conforming citizen. Emerson says it demands
something Godlike in one who would essay such a
task, not placing the same values on money, trade,
commerce, and profits as the natural money maker
and money lover, and not the opportunity to substitute
and supplement the usual motives by and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
with the larger, and to me more compelling, of
community betterment and employee welfare....”
This man had abandoned his wife and three children.</p>

<p>Another patient writes of himself, “The hypersensitive
nervous system with the initial shock has
inhibited the development of my highest potentialities
and my highest endeavors.” He summarizes
his symptoms: “Dread and anxiety about being
away from home and friends, self-consciousness,
mental sluggishness, quick fatigue, inability for deep
thought, general state of irritability.”</p>

<p>A neurotic patient tells me that he suffers from
fatigue, insomnia, dullness, inability of concentration
of attention, failure in studies, slowness of
comprehension, and so on; and yet he gives his opinion
with papal infallibility on every conceivable subject,
and hints at being an undeveloped, unappreciated
genius. The psychopathic, neurotic patient
rarely, if ever, suffers from a complaint of
inferiority. His real fear is that his superiority
may be humbled.</p>

<p>Obsessed by the impulse of self-preservation and
fear instinct, and with utter disregard of others,
the patients are convinced of their extraordinary
kindness, gentleness, sympathy, martyrdom, and
even saintliness. It is from this class that neurotic
philanthropists are recruited. Psychopathic patients
are always ready “to sacrifice themselves for
the good of humanity.” They talk endlessly about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
goodness, and may even devote themselves to charity
and instruction of the “poor and degraded.”
A patient of mine worked for three years for the
“good of the poor,” had “high ideals and a sensitive
conscience,” according to his accounts, but abandoned
readily his wife and children.</p>

<p>Another young woman, a typical psychopathic,
full of high ideals, ran away with a married man,
had a child that died of exposure. This patient
was interested in modern education and improvement
of humanity. In reality she never cared to
do anything for anybody, and without any hesitation
took advantage of others in order to satisfy
the least whim that might have crossed her mind,
especially those whims that relate to health. She
had all kinds of directions, prescriptions, exercises,
requisite for the strength and health of the body
and the nerves.</p>

<p>One of my patients used to be anxious about
my going and coming. Was it love or devotion?
I found out that he was afraid that I might be
killed. This fear was developed in him by an
actual accident in which his brother had died, but
the same fear associated with me was due to the
fact that the patient was sure that my treatment
was requisite for his health and welfare. He was
in fear lest I might be killed, he would be unable
to get his treatments, and thus lose time in getting
back his health.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>For the sake of his “health” the patient will not
stop at anything. Neurotics may well name their
troubles “Health and Science.” <em>The psychopathic,
neurotic patient makes of health his science and religion,
because self-preservation and fear are at the
bottom of the psychopathic, neurotic constitution.</em></p>

<br />
NEUROTIC PARASITISM</h2>


<p>The psychopathic patient may be regarded as a
case of parasitism. The parasite, living on his host,
gradually loses all active functions, a condition followed
by atrophy of organs no longer necessary to
the life existence of the organism.</p>

<p>According to Demoor, “Atrophy begins with
function when an organ has become useless. This
uselessness may arise from two causes: the function
may be no longer useful to the individual or
to the species, or it may be assumed by another
organ.” When an organism turns parasite it is
an economy of nutrition and energy to save as
much as possible. The tendency of parasitism is
to dispense with unnecessary functions in the struggle
for existence.</p>

<p>The loss of function is from the less useful,
to the more useful, to the functions absolutely
indispensable to survival; from the less essential,
to the more essential, to functions absolutely essential
to the life existence of the individual. The
life activity of the parasite becomes more and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
narrowed, circumscribed, and dwindles down to a
few functions requisite to its life existence, namely
self-preservation, nutrition, and reproduction.</p>

<p>With the further increase of parasitism even the
digestive and reproductive functions become simplified,
the parasitic individual becomes reduced to the
most fundamental of all impulses, the impulse of
self-preservation and reproduction.</p>

<p>The penalty of parasitic life is the <em>simplification</em>
of organic activities, the atrophy of all higher and
complex life processes. This is what takes place
in the case of the psychopathic individual. All
higher activities, all higher interests cease.</p>

<p>In many neurotic cases of the severe type even
<em>the sexual instinct becomes gradually atrophied.
The patient’s life is narrowed down to the impulse
which is absolutely requisite for individual life
existence, namely the impulse of self-preservation
with its concomitant fear instinct.</em></p>

<p>The growth of the impulse of self-preservation
with its fear instinct brings about their hypertrophy
which in turn hastens the degenerative processes or
atrophy of all higher and more complex activities.
The psychopathic patient in the process of degeneration
and atrophy falls so low that not only
moral, social, intellectual, but simpler psychomotor
reactions become gradually diminished and atrophied.
<em>In severe cases even the instinct of sex, requisite for
the preservation of the species, is made subservient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
to the impulse of self-preservation and the fear
instinct.</em></p>

<p>In psychopathic life all activities are narrowed
down to the pettiness of individual existence. It is
not sex, it is not species-interests, nor conflicts, nor
self-repressions that trouble the neurotic patient.
An abnormal impulse of self-preservation and fear
instinct are at the bottom of all psychopathic
miseries. <em>All psychopathic, neurotic interests are
reduced to the sorry life of self and fear.</em></p>

<p>Lacking interest in anything but himself, terrorized
by the fear of existence, the psychopathic
patient lives a dreary, monotonous life out of which
he seeks to escape. Monotony, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennui</i>, indifference
form the curse of his life. The patient is in a frantic
condition, constantly in quest of interests which he
cannot enjoy. Nothing can interest him, because
he has no other interest but himself, and that is
so narrow, that it can hardly fill existence.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact he is afraid to meet his fears,
he is afraid of himself. He is afraid to come to a
decision, never at peace, ever at war with himself.
He is bored with himself, wearied with everything
and with everybody. He is constantly eager to find
new pastures and new excitements, so as to fill with
some living interest his poor, narrow, mean, short
existence obsessed by fear, misery, wretchedness, and
brutish selfishness.</p>

<p>The patient is afraid to work, because it may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
“fatigue and exhaust” him, and may bring about
a state of disease, while he looks for health. He
has no interest, because he only thinks of his little
self, reduced to digestion, evacuation, and sleeping.
The psychopathic patient leads an inactive existence
of a sluggard, a lazy, idle existence of a
parasite, and still he is driven to life and activity
which, from the very nature of his narrow, parasitic
individuality, he can no longer enjoy. He has the
ideals of a hero and lives the life of a coward. This
puts the patient in a state of dissatisfaction, discontent,
and ceaseless contest with himself and others.
Fear and self never leave him at peace. He is ever
in a state of agitation, restlessness, and anxiety.</p>

<p>Obsessed with the anxious fears of self-impulse,
the patient avoids the terrors of life, and drags the
grey, monotonous existence of a worm. Hence there
is a tendency in the psychopathic patient to be on
the lookout for ever new energetic personalities,
lean on them, suck out all the energies he possibly
can, then reject his new friends unhesitatingly and
brutally, and be again in search for new personalities
who can disperse, for ever so brief a time, the fearful
monotony and dread of his miserable, psychopathic,
neurotic existence.</p>

<p>The neurotic patient may be characterized as a
psychopathic leech, or truer still, a psychopathic
vampire. For it is on the life and blood of other
people that the psychopathic ogre is enabled to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
carry on his bewitched, accursed, narrow, selfish existence,
full of terror and anguish of life.</p>

<p>“When the attack is on,” exclaimed a psychopathic
patient, affected with cardiac palpitation and
intense fear, “I am too d&mdash;&mdash;d scared about myself
to think about her!” referring to the woman with
whom he was in love. The psychopathic patient is
a parasitic ogre with an hypertrophied ego.</p>

<p>Patients who claim to love children when the latter
are well and healthy, avoid them, like a pest,
when the children happen to fall sick, for fear of
disease and for fear that the sick children may
produce an evil influence on the patient’s “sensitive”
nerves. The patient is afraid to come near sickness,
or even afraid to hear of evil things, such as description
of misfortunes, ailments, accidents, and sufferings,
because they may upset him and arouse his
fears of himself.</p>

<p>All the patient wants is to be surrounded with
cheer, joy, merriment, excitement, and happiness
which he is unable to enjoy. The psychopathic patient
is in constant search after happiness. Not
that he is interested in the problem of happiness
from a moral, philosophical, or even purely religious
standpoint. His interest is of the crudest, the meanest,
the most selfish kind. It is happiness for self,&mdash;for
a low, mean, short, and brutish self. Psychopathic
search for happiness is the anguish of the
beast, cornered by terror. The patient is tortured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
by an unsuccessful search for happiness, ever tantalized
by self and fear. Egotism, fear, ennui, restlessness,
anxiety, discord are the harpies of psychopathic,
neurotic life.</p>

<p><em>The love of the psychopathic patient is at bottom
self-love</em>; it is like the love of the wolf for the lamb.
Lover, husband, child, friend, father, mother,
brother, sister, are all victims to the patient’s greedy
self.</p>

<p>The fear instinct has a positive and negative aspect.
There is the fear of life, fear of putting
forth energy in meeting the exigencies of life. The
patient is afraid to participate in the struggle of
life. Struggle spells to him danger, peril,&mdash;fear of
the external world. Struggle means to him fear,
suffering, and misery. The patient avoids society,
avoids not only strangers, but even his acquaintances,
friends, and sometimes his own family.</p>

<p>While he constantly craves for ever new stimulations
to his depleted nerves, he is at the same time
in terror of everything that is <em>new</em>. The patient is
afraid of life, he shirks duties, responsibilities, efforts,
and joys of life struggle. Hence his love of
automatism, routine, and fear-fatigue.</p>

<p>The fear manifests itself more often in the form
of the negative side of life, such as fear of sickness,
weakness, incapacity, degradation, loss of
vitality, and generally the fear of death. <em>Neurotic
states are due to fear of life and fear of death.</em></p>

<br />
FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES</h2>


<p>The following principles may be regarded as
fundamental in the development of psychopathic or
nervous ills:</p>


<h3>I. <em>The Principle of Embryonic Psychogenesis</em></h3>

<p>The mental states of psychopathic or nervous ills
are of an infantile, child type. In this respect the
mental states simulate cancerous and other malignant
growths of an embryonic character. The psychopathic
mental states are not only of a childish
character, but they are often associated with child
experiences of early life. The psychopathic condition
points to some early fear-producing experience,
or fear awakening shock.</p>


<h3>II. <em>The Principle of Recurrence</em></h3>

<p>Fear experiences tend to repeat themselves in
consciousness, and especially in the subconscious
states of the child. This repetition or recurrence
keeps alive the psychopathic fear nucleus, and <em>fixes</em>
it in the mind. Fixed fear systems become further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
developed by the subsequent experiences of life. The
aroused fear instinct may either become weakened
or strengthened. When the conditions of life are
unfavorable and adverse, tending to further cultivation
of the impulse of self-preservation and the
fear instinct, the outcome is a psychopathic disposition,
ending in a nervous state with typical symptoms
of some definite nervous trouble, formed by the
<em>latest</em> or <em>ultimate</em> fear experiences.</p>


<h3>III. <em>The Principle of Proliferation and
Complication</em></h3>

<p>With the growth of the child the fear experiences
increase and multiply. These experiences become
associated with the original child nucleus of fear
and thus a complexity of fear systems is built up.
Worries, depressions, and anxieties help to increase
and develop the psychopathic system of
groups of fear experiences. The morbid state grows
like an avalanche in its progress downwards.</p>


<h3>IV. <em>The Principle of Fusion or of Synthesis</em></h3>

<p>All the fear experiences become associated and
grouped gradually around the original child fear
experience which is often of a subconscious character.
The long series of fear experiences becomes fused
and synthesized by the central fear instinct and
impulse of self-preservation, which are fundamental
in every being, but which have been specially cultivated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
by the course of events and experiences in
the neurotic patient. The experiences become fused,
synthesized, and systematized, forming one complex
network of closely interrelated fear obsessions with
the fear instinct and impulse of self preservation
in the background.</p>


<h3>V. <em>The Principle of Contrast</em></h3>

<p>Feelings and emotions follow by contrast. Excitement
is followed by depression, enjoyment by
disgust, exhilaration by disappointment. This is
well brought out in the changes observed in the
psychopathic self and fear states.</p>

<p>Fear may be followed by <em>anger</em>, especially
against those who are sure to show no opposition,
or may even manifest fear. The excitement of fear
in others is a way which diminishes fear in the
patient and helps him to have confidence in himself,
strengthening his impulse of self preservation.</p>

<p>The fear of the psychopathic may even resort to
love so as to gain safety and protection from the
tantalizing agonies of the fear instinct. <em>That is
why some physicians are deceived, and ascribe psychopathic
troubles to love instead of to the real
fundamental cause of all psychopathic disorders,
namely self-preservation and the fear instinct.</em></p>

<p>Similarly mysticism, a psychopathic malady of
a social character, has its origin in the impulse of
self-preservation and the fear instinct, and takes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
refuge in “love” or in “union” with the Infinite
which serves as a rock of protection, security, and
salvation from all terrors of life. <em>Psychopathic love
is a neurotic fear delusion.</em> There is nothing more
deceptive and delusive than psychopathic love,&mdash;for
it takes its origin in self and fear.</p>


<h3>VI. <em>The Principle of Recession</em></h3>

<p>Experiences are blotted out from memory in the
course of time. A very small percentage of impressions
is registered by the brain, a still smaller
percentage can be reproduced, and out of them a
very small percentage carries <em>recognition</em> as memory,
that is, of impressions experienced before.
<em>Forgetfulness is therefore a normal physiological
function characteristic of the brain and mind.</em></p>

<p>Forgetfulness depends on at least three conditions,
lack of registration, lack of reproduction, and lack
of recognition.</p>

<p>There will correspondingly be at least three forms
of amnesia or forgetfulness, <em>amnesia of registration,
amnesia of reproduction, and amnesia of recognition</em>.
The real problem of Psychology is not so
much the lapses of memory, but the <em>why</em> and <em>how</em>
of memory, and especially of recognitive memory.</p>

<p>This, however, we may establish as a law that
when memory in regard to definite experiences weakens
in the course of time, the lapse follows <em>from recognition
to reproduction, and finally to registration</em>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
Recognition fails first, then comes the failure of
memory reproduction, and finally memory registration
of the special experience becomes blurred and
wiped out. This may be termed <em>the law of memory
decay, or of memory regression</em>. This is the principle
of memory recession.</p>

<p>Some, though by no means all, child memories
or infantile experiences follow this law of regression
or recession. Child experiences, like all old experiences,
tend to recede in their course of decay
or of regression below the threshold of consciousness.
The experiences are not recognized on reproduction,
or are reproduced with great difficulty,
or have even lost the function of being reproduced.
When under such conditions, the experiences are said
to have become subconscious, or have receded into
the subconscious.</p>

<p>On the other hand some of those subconscious experiences,
or subconscious memories may, under favorable
conditions, once more regain their functions
of reproduction and recognition, and become fully
conscious. This may occur in various trance states,
subconscious states, and in various psychopathic
conditions.</p>

<p>Such states, however, rarely fix the experiences in
memory, because the states are instable, temporary,
and the memories lapse with the disappearance of
the states. This principle of recession may be regarded
as one of the fundamental facts of the Psychopathology<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
of the Subconscious. In fact, <em>subconscious
states may also be termed Recessive States</em>.</p>


<h3>VII. <em>The Principle of Dissociation</em></h3>

<p>Recessive states, becoming marginal and subconscious,
lapse from voluntary control, they cannot
be recalled deliberately and consciously by the
activities of voluntary, recognitive, associative
memories, constituting the mental life of personality,
and hence may be regarded as mental systems
in a state of <em>dissociation</em>. The lapsed states are
present subconsciously when not completely blurred
and obliterated by the process of decay or regression.</p>

<p>Dissociated, subconscious states, when affected by
the impulse of self-preservation and the fear instinct,
tend to become parasitic, and like malignant growths
may suck the life energy of the affected individual.
Under such conditions we have psychopathic, subconscious,
dissociated states.</p>


<h3>VIII. <em>The Principle of Irradiation and Diffusion</em></h3>

<p>In the dormant, subconscious states the fear instinct
gradually extends to other subconscious
states. The fear instinct acts like a malignant
growth, like a fermenting enzyme. The subconscious
fear instinct gradually infiltrates, diffuses, irradiates
its affective state throughout the subconscious
life of the patient, finally giving rise to a psychopathic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
disposition with its selfishness, apparent repressions,
apprehension, anxiety, anguish, terror,
and panic. This may also give rise to the general
psychopathic character of doubt, indecision, and
<em>conflicting</em> states, all being determined by the underlying
fear instinct.</p>


<h3>IX. <em>The Principle of Differentiation</em></h3>

<p>With the growth of the impulse of self preservation
and with the development of an exaggerated
fear instinct, the individual becomes more and more
neurotic and psychopathic. This general, neurotic,
mental state attaches itself to various events in the
life of the individual. The psychopathic disposition
keeps on progressing from one event to another.
Each one may be regarded as a separate fear state,
or phobia. Finally the disposition may settle on
the last event in the patient’s life experience. This
last event may often become the nucleus, or rather
the apparent nucleus of the neurosis.</p>

<p>The last experience appears to be central. <em>As a
matter of fact there is a great number of fear states
or of phobias in the neurotic patient.</em> A few only
appear to predominate in the network of fear events.
The network of fears is woven into an incongruous
whole by the impulse of self-preservation and the
fear instinct. This network becomes differentiated
into a tangle of numerous fear states.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>


<h3>X. <em>The Principle of Dominance</em></h3>

<p>The last fear states or <em>Ultimate Fear States</em>
which stand out clearly and distinctly in the patient’s
mind become the leading, the dominant abnormal,
pathological states. The patient thinks
that they are the real source of all his troubles, and
if they were removed he would be cured. As a
matter of fact the ultimate states are not <em>causes</em>, but
<em>occasions. The real causes of the psychopathic
constitution are the exaggerated impulse of self-preservation
and the intensified fear instinct.</em></p>


<h3>XI. <em>The Principle of Dynamogenesis</em></h3>

<p>Recessive, and especially dissociated systems, being
dormant subconsciously, may become envigorated,
may accumulate emotion, and when the opportunity
comes, may react to external stimuli with
vigor and energy. The attacks may occur like
epileptic fits. They often so well simulate epileptic
maladies that even good clinicians have classed
such attacks under the term of larval epilepsy,
psychic epilepsy, hystero-epilepsy, or psychic
equivalent of epilepsy. This subconscious energy
manifestation may be termed <em>Dynamogenesis</em>.</p>


<h3>XII. <em>The Principle of Inhibition</em></h3>

<p>Self-preservation and the fear instinct inhibit
associated mental systems, producing morbid states.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
<em>Morbid mental states, however, are not produced by
inhibitions, or repressions.</em> It is only when the inhibitive
factors are self and fear that a true morbid
mental state, or neurosis arises. To regard self repression
as a bad condition and leading to diseases
is to misapprehend the nature of man, to falsify
psychology, and to misrepresent the development
of humanity. The self should not become hypertrophied.
Self-preservation should not become overgrown.
The self must be kept within limits. The
self impulse should be kept under control by the
individual. For true happiness is to be a law unto
oneself. As the great Greek thinkers put it: Happiness
is in self rule. The unruly are miserable.
In fact, self-control is absolutely requisite to mental
health, to sanity. <em>Self-repression is requisite for
happiness. Self-repression never leads to disease.</em>
It is only when self-repression is produced and
dominated by selfishness and fear that morbid states
of a psychopathic, neurotic character are sure to
arise. It is not inhibitions that produce fear, but
<em>it is fear that produces inhibitions</em>. To ascribe
neurosis to self-repression and to conflict is like
attributing malaria or tuberculosis to air and light.</p>


<h3>XIII. <em>The Principle of Mental Contest and
Discord</em></h3>

<p>Mental states associated with intense emotions
tend to take a dominant lead in consciousness. This,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
however, may be totally opposed by the general
character of the individual. In such cases the
whole mental set, being in opposition to the total
individuality, is in contest with the character of the
person who is then in state of discord. A mental
set in contest with the make-up of the person is
usually inhibited, becomes subconscious, and as a
rule fades away from the mind, often leaving no
trace even in memory, conscious or subconscious.
In some cases where a compromise is possible, a
reconciliation is effected. The mental set is assimilated,
and disappears from consciousness as an
independent, functioning state.</p>

<p>When, however, the opposing or contesting mental
set is based on a fundamental impulse and accompanying
instinct, such as the impulse of self-preservation
and the fear instinct, a total inhibition is
not always possible, even a compromise may not be
successful, because the mental set is in association
with the core of the individual,&mdash;namely self-preservation.
The contesting mental set remains, in what
Galton terms, “the antechamber of consciousness.”
The mind is in a state of tension, in a state of
anxiety, in restless, uneasy discord, due to the fear
instinct, the companion of the impulse of self-preservation.
The contesting mental set, charged with
intense fear emotion, presses into the foreground
of consciousness, and a contest, a discord, ensues in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
the mind of the individual, a contest, a discord,
a conflict which keeps the person in a state of indecision
and lack of will power.</p>

<p>The partly inhibited, contesting mental set, when
not fading away, may thus remain in the mind,
and act like a splinter in the flesh, giving rise to
a state of discomfort. This is just what happens
when the individual has not been trained to assimilate
fear states, and is unable to adjust fear
reactions to the welfare of total psycho-physiological
life activity.</p>

<p>In cases where the impulse of self-preservation
and the fear instinct have become aroused, the contesting
fear set of mental states presses again
and again to the foreground of consciousness.
When no compromise of the contesting states can
be brought about, when the fear set cannot be assimilated,
the mind is in a state of restless discord.
<em>It is not, however, the discord that produces the
neurosis, it is the impulse of self-preservation and
the fear instinct that constitute the cause of the
psychopathic, neurotic condition.</em></p>


<h3>XIV. <em>The Principle of Diminishing Resistance</em></h3>

<p>In proportion as the neurotic attacks keep on
recurring the formed pathological system is gaining
in energy and in ease of manifestation. The
psychopathic attacks with their symptoms emerge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
at an ever diminishing intensity of stimulation. The
resistance of healthy normal associations is ever
on the decrease until a point is reached when all
power of resistance is lost. The conscious and subconscious
groups which enter into the psychopathic
system, forming the neurosis, get control over the
patient’s life, and become an uncontrollable, psychopathic
obsession.</p>


<h3>XV. <em>The Principle of Modification</em></h3>

<p>The patient attempts to control or alleviate his
fear state by a totally different fear state. In the
long run this is a losing game. For the general fear
disposition becomes ultimately reinforced. Finally
he may land in the mystic regions of love or of an
Infinite Love in which he expects to find safety,
protection, and salvation from the miseries of exaggerated
self impulse and intensified fear instinct.
Such a course, however, leads to a swamp in which
the patient’s individuality becomes engulfed and
obliterated. The end is mental suicide.</p>

<p>These fundamental principles of neurosis-development
should be kept in mind in the examination
and study of psychopathic cases. The cases adduced
in this volume will help one to understand
the mechanism of the main factors and principles of
neurosis.</p>

ILLUSTRATIONS, NEUROTIC HISTORIES</h2>


<p>The psychopathic character appears to be full
of contradictions, “a house divided against itself.”
Neurotics are like “the troubled ocean which
never rests.” Some of my patients complain of
fatigue, physical and especially intellectual, inability
of concentration of attention, and yet they
hint at being undeveloped, unappreciated geniuses.
The patient may be said to suffer from a paradoxical
state of “humble superiority.”</p>

<p>A few of my cases may help one to form some
faint idea of the intensity of the impulse of self-preservation
and fear instinct which obsess the
psychopathic sufferer.</p>

<p>M. A. Age 43, female, married; sister and
brother died of tuberculosis. When young, she herself
had an attack of tuberculosis from which, however,
she entirely recovered. This made her, from
her very childhood, think of herself and of the fear
of death. She suffers from headaches, backaches,
indigestion, and intestinal pains. Her mind is entirely
engrossed with herself. The whole world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
is for her sake, and she does not scruple to utilize
anyone who is willing to serve her. She takes advantage
of everybody and does not care what the
feeling of others might be about her extreme selfishness.
If she were sure that no fine or punishment
would follow, she would not hesitate to take anything
that belongs to others, no matter whether it
be a friend or enemy, provided it does her good,
drives away some of her discomforts, fear of disease,
or gives pleasure to her, even at the expense
of other people’s agonies. If there were a prize
for selfishness, she would be sure to get it. She is
sure to take advantage of people who do not know
her and who practice the ordinary activities and
amenities of life in regard to her. She does not get
offended when people refuse her demands. She goes
to look for other victims who have as yet no knowledge
of her temperament and “sickness.” Everything
is legitimate to her in order to get well and
healthy.</p>

<p>The patient talks of high ideals and of service to
humanity, and yet she has not hesitated to lure
away a man who had a wife and three children.
She made him divorce his wife who was her bosom
friend, and marry herself. She spends all his
money on her “artistic dresses,” while his former
wife and his little family are allowed just enough
to keep them from starvation. The patient goes
around travelling, visits physicians, cures herself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
keeps on being sick in various health resorts, learning
all kinds of fads, modes of “healthy living.”</p>

<p>The patient is in terror of disease and of old
age. She fears even to think of such things. She
carries around with her all kinds of prescriptions
and directions as to how to preserve youth. I was
especially instructed by her husband not to inquire
for her age. Everything must be subservient to
her impulse of self-preservation and instinct of fear.
She has dwindled to a parasitic existence, obsessed
with the lowest instincts of life. She avoids all
responsibilities. She wants to get as much as she
can in order to obtain for herself the highest possible
benefit. When she meets people who do not
know her, she is quick in taking advantage of them.
Life to her has no duties but rights. Patient is a
typical Nero, a Caligula. She would cheerfully
sacrifice a nation to get out a mite of pleasure,
comfort, and health.</p>

<p>V. S. Age 49, female. Married; no children.
She has three sisters and two brothers who are all
well. As a child she lived in great poverty. She
was neglected and met with accidents and scares;
suffered from sickness until her little body was
emaciated from privation. She managed, however,
to go through school and become a clerk in a small
store; she was very careful of her appearance which
meant to her a good marriage, comfortable life.
She also took care of her health which was rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
precarious, on account of the many colds accompanied
by severe headaches. At the same time on
account of the poor life led, she also suffered from
some obscure troubles. After years of precarious
health and quests for happiness, for marriage, she
succeeded in capturing a well-to-do merchant in
whose store she had worked as a clerk. Immediately
after marriage she rigged up a beautiful home
with “rich mahogany furniture” which the husband
regarded with a gasp, settled down to a life of
leisure, to complete idleness, and began to attend
to her health....</p>

<p>The patient began to find more and more troubles
with her organs, from the top of her head to the
pelvis and intestines. Nothing was quite right.
Things could be improved. The impulse of self-preservation
gained more and more control over
her. Along with this impulse the fear instinct
gained in strength, became more and more extensive.</p>

<p>The patient became full of fear which, by the
principle of proliferation and diffusion, kept on
growing and diffusing in ever new directions, and
spreading to ever new associations and systems. The
central fear was poverty. The patient was afraid
she might become poor. This was naturally a
fear from her early childhood,&mdash;the fear of suffering
in poverty, a fear which persisted throughout
her life. The fear became accentuated and developed
with time. She was afraid to spend money,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
especially sums above a five dollar bill. No matter
how much she tried to reason with herself this fear
persisted. She was afraid to buy new things which
she regarded more or less expensive. She was
afraid to put on new dresses, to buy new furniture,
to spend money in any way. In fact, quite often
the fear was so uncontrollable that even when she
had no thought of threatening poverty she was
in a panic of being confronted with expensive purchases.</p>

<p>The fears then began to spread to other things,&mdash;such
as giving away small articles or loaning
books, or presenting any things or objects that
might be regarded as expensive and valuable. The
fears spread to other objects of importance and
value.</p>

<p>Along with it she had fears of indigestion and
nutrition, nausea, vomiting, intestinal pains, discomfort,
and especially an inordinate amount of distress
when in a state of nervous excitement.</p>

<p>The patient was as obstinate as a mule, though
claiming that she was doing her best and trying
everything in her power to co-operate. She was
doing everything in her power to frustrate the
physician’s directions, claiming at the same time
that she was doing her best to follow scrupulously
the doctor’s orders. She claimed she was nice to
people when she was nasty and offensive to everybody
who in any way happened not to fall in with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
her whims and caprices. In fact, even those who
went out of their way to please her and did everything
in attending to her, and helping her in every
way day and night, even those she treated with
lack of consideration, even positive disdain and
contempt. She was the incarnation of demoniacal
obsession of psychopathic meanness and egotism.</p>

<p>She abused and dominated her husband by her
sickness, trouble, fainting and crying spells, headaches,
moans and weeping. She made him do everything
she pleased. In fact, she tyrannized over her
husband, and kept on claiming she loved him. She
could not for a moment be without him, and complained
that on account of her extreme devotion to
him, “her will was broken.”</p>

<p>She was a regular termagant, a demon incarnate.
She knew how to make a scene and put the blame
on her “dear ones.” It was enough for her to suspect
what her friends wanted her to do, she was sure
out of sheer malice, to act the contrary. She was
distrustful, spying on others, sneaky and lying without
any scruples; and yet “no one was so mild,
so ideal, so kind, so affectionate, so considerate, so
calm as she was.” She went around reciting poetry
about ideals, health, and happiness. She persuaded
herself that she was highly educated, that she was
the best business woman, the best critic, appreciative
of poetry and of art in general. She was a veritable
Nero, an “egomaniac” devoid of all love and human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
sympathy. She suffered so much, because she was
so unusually altruistic. A coyote in her fear, a
tigress in her rage, she claimed the gentleness of the
dove and the innocence of the babe.</p>

<p>Not for a moment could she fix her attention on
anything but herself, eating, drinking, sleeping, and
feeling. Nothing interested her but herself. She
avoided work, however short and easy. She could,
however, talk of herself, of her achievements, of her
moral, intellectual qualities by the hour and by
the day. Even games did not interest her, nothing
but herself, and self. This was so evident that one
of the attendants noticed this characteristic psychopathic
trait, and described her as “egomaniac.”
She was the “Great I am.” “The Ego-person is the
reflection of the Ego-god.” ...</p>

<p>Whenever one spoke of a great man, she was
sure to have her opinion of him. She was at any
rate superior to him. She could give her opinion
on any conceivable subject in literature, economics,
and politics.</p>

<p>She was as cunning as a savage, and as treacherous
as a wild brute, and yet she was to all appearances
a veritable saint, full of suffering for the sins
of humanity, and for the faults of her husband who
was “boyish and foolish, whom she had to manage,”
and whom she did control and handle with an iron
rod.</p>

<p>There is no doubt, however, that she herself was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
driven by her intense, uncontrollable impulse of self-preservation
and by the instinct of fear. What
especially terrorized her was the slow but sure <em>extension
of the fear instinct to more and more objects
and acts</em>. The fear instinct kept on creeping
on her, slowly choking the life sources of her being.
To call the patient “egocentric” is a mild descriptive
term,&mdash;“tigress,” “satan,” “fiend,” would be
more appropriate appellations. In her terror of
self-preservation she tormented herself and others.
She was a firebrand from hell, a firebrand fanned by
the furies of self and fear.</p>

<p>F. W. Age 47; female, married; has no children.
The patient claims to have been an invalid from
childhood; that she was of extremely delicate health;
she always had to take care of her health, and had
to go through all kinds of diseases, especially gastro-intestinal
troubles. At the age of eighteen she got
married and then her family felicity began. She began
to complain of all kinds of infirmities. The
gynecologist humored her with operations and treatments.
The fear disease became strengthened, and
finally she cultivated a typical pathophobia; she
was in terror of some fearful malady that might
possibly take possession of her.</p>

<p>The patient always wanted to have someone near
her. This fear of remaining alone dated from childhood,
when at the least discomfort, she asked and
screamed in terror for help. A companion, or nurse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
had to be with her day and night, so as to protect
her from any impending evil.</p>

<p>Occasionally, to relieve her feelings, in the middle
of a conversation, whether for the sake of impressing
her family, her husband or her physicians with
the gravity of her disease, or as a vent for the
rising instinct of fear, she emitted a scream, wild
and weird, reminding one of the howling of a timber
wolf, or of a wild whoop of an Indian. This was a
habit she kept up from childhood. It was a reaction
of her fears, and a protection, it was a call for
help which was sure to attract attention. The
family could not refuse help at hearing such an
unearthly call. Later on, it was consciously and
unconsciously utilized by the patient as a rod to rule
the family and especially her husband, when the latter
happened to become refractory. The fear reaction
was thus used as a protection and as a weapon
of defense.</p>

<p>Things had to run according to her pleasure,
or else she was put in a state of nervous excitement
and fear with its awful yell of which the
family and the husband were in perfect terror; they
yielded unconditionally. The patient literally subjugated
her husband by her spells of fear, especially
by the fearful acoustic performance, the aura, the
harbinger of a psychopathic attack.</p>

<p>The <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'patient was aways'">patient was always</ins> discontented and grumpy.
Nothing could satisfy her, nothing was good enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
for her. Everybody was criticized. No matter
how one tried to please her, she always found fault
with the person. In fact, the fault-finding was in
proportion to the eagerness one tried to serve and
oblige her. The nurses are not good, the servants
intolerable, and people in general are bad, mean,
stupid, and vulgar. She claims she comes from
an “old New England family, from good stock.”
Her grandfather was a fisherman, and her father a
petty tradesman. The patient makes pretensions to
education, poetry, art, and drawing. In reality, she
is quite dull and ignorant.</p>

<p>G. A. Female, age 63; the patient was obsessed
with pathophobia for over thirty-five years. She
has been to a number of physicians, and to many
sanitariums, looking for health everywhere, not finding
it anywhere. The fears date to her early childhood.
She was regarded as a delicate child, the
fear of disease was strongly impressed on her. She
went through a number of children’s diseases.
Although she had several sisters and brothers,
the child’s supposed delicate constitution was the
fear and worry of the parents. This fear was communicated
to the child, who for the rest of her life
became a psychopathic patient with the characteristic
developed impulse of self-preservation and intense
fear of disease. She could not think of anybody
but herself, everything had to be arranged
for her,&mdash;for her food, for her sleep, and for her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
rest. She kept on complaining at the slightest
change either in herself, in others, about the arrangements
of the house, or about the weather.
Everything had to be arranged just as she demanded,
otherwise she was sick, or was going to
become dangerously ill.</p>

<p>When about the age of thirty, she married a
widower with two children. She trained the children
to obey her commands implicitly, otherwise
she resorted to the rod of sickness. The pathophobia,
consciously or unconsciously, became a
power which she wielded in the most tyrannical way.
The children had to sacrifice themselves for the
pleasure of the sick step-mother. They had to stay
with her, and minister to all her whims and fears.
The very individuality of the children became almost
obliterated by the persistent, egotistic tyranny of
the sick, old step-mother. She was like a regular
vampire, sucking the life blood of her family.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that the same fear of
disease tamed her husband over whom she ruled with
an iron hand. The least opposition to her whims,
or to her fears of possible disease made her so sick
with all kinds of pains that the family and the
husband were driven into submission.</p>

<p>The woman was obese as a hippopotamus, well
nourished, with a florid complexion, and with an
appetite that would shame a Gargantua. The
rarest, the best, and the most appetizing dainties<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
had to be on her table. She made of her meals
a form of worship, requisite to propitiate the goddess
of maladies. She did not hesitate to take
the best morsels from the plates of her daughter
and son in order to satisfy her appetite which was
supposed to be “delicate and small.”</p>

<p>The patient was conscious of every square inch
in her body; she was afraid that some form of
malady may lurk there. She was a typical case of
pathophobia. Fear of disease and quest of health
were ever in her mind. She could not talk, or
think of anything else, but herself and her symptoms.
She made of her step-daughter a poor, colorless
being, a day and night nurse, tyrannized over
by pitiful, neurotic whimpering.</p>

<p>When the patient happened to wake during the
night for ever so short a period of time, she did
not hesitate to wake her step-daughter, tired as
the latter was by constant attendance on this psychopathic
shrew. The daughter had to wake up
everybody who could in any way bring comfort
to that “poor, old, suffering invalid.” After much
groaning, moaning, and bewailing her bitter lot
the invalid took some medicine to appease the fear
of disease, partook of some nourishing food to keep
up her strength and health, and went to sleep for
the rest of the night.</p>

<p>Years ago, the patient was under the care of
Weir Mitchell who sent her to me as a last resort.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Dr. Weir Mitchell characterized the patient as an
“American humbug.” As a matter of fact, the patient
herself was convinced that she was on the
verge of death, and was in terrible agony of her
fears of disease, fears which made her quest for
health a matter of life and death. The patient was
obsessed by <em>parasitic egotism</em>, the <em>quintessence of
psychopathic affections</em>.</p>

<p>Many times during the day she paced the room
reciting elevating passages from the Bible, from
“great poets,”&mdash;Emerson being her favorite writer.</p>

<p>I have heard neurotics with their “Mortal Mind,”
“Sin and Error,” “Disease and Nothing,” recite
edifying phrases such as: “The decaying flower,
the blighted bud, the gnarled oak, the ferocious
beast, like the discords of disease, sin, and death are
unnatural” ... “Fear is inflammation, error” ...
“<em>Adam, a-dam, a-dam, dam, dam</em>”....</p>

<p>A man, thirty-eight years old, married, highly
sensitive, suffers from migraine; he is irritable and
restless. When about eight years old, he wandered
in the woods near his house. An Italian ran after
him, flourishing a big knife. The boy ran away
in terror. When he reached home he dropped from
exhaustion and fear. Once or twice, on account of
the fear of sharp objects, he actually hurt himself
while handling knives. This increased his terror and
fixed his fear. The instinct of fear was still further
developed and stimulated by a series of events,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
such as falling into a river, from which he was
saved. He does not like to take baths, he is afraid
to enter a river, and he is in terror of sharp objects,
such as knives and razors.</p>

<p>The patient is extremely selfish. He insists on
playing games which he likes much, irrespective
of the pleasure of his friends and acquaintances.
All he cares for is to have a good time, to neglect
his duties to his family. In his business he is
exacting of others, although he himself is rather
slovenly in his work, and slow in the performance
of his obligations. He always insists on having his
own way. Other people’s rights do not trouble
him, provided his rights are carefully and scrupulously
observed. He always demands services from
others, especially from his friends.</p>

<p>The patient’s mind is occupied with his health,
his fears, and his ailments. The interest he takes
in his friends and acquaintances is how far they
may serve his purposes of pleasure, game, health,
and avoidance of fear of disease. His wife and
child are regarded from a personal standpoint of
his own good, otherwise they are totally ignored.
When they interfere with him, or arouse his fears,
he becomes impatient, angry, and furious. He
claims to be the most considerate and kindest of
men, brimful of humanitarian ideals. He thinks
that he can accomplish more than anyone else in
his circumstances. Nothing is too good for him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
nobody is superior to him. As a rule things are
badly conducted, he finds fault with everybody and
with everything. He is driven by psychopathic
furies,&mdash;discord, fear, and maddening egotism.</p>

HYPNOIDAL TREATMENT</h2>


<p><em>Psychopathic or neurotic maladies do not depend
on the abnormal action of some one organ
or function, but on a general condition common
to all bodily and mental functions,&mdash;the fundamental
primitive fear instinct which relates to life in general.</em></p>

<p>The deranged functions, cardiac, respiratory, or
sexual,&mdash;fatigue, conflict, shock, repression and
others are only the <em>occasions</em>. To regard any of
these occasions as the sources of psychopathic maladies
is like regarding the weather-cock as the cause
of the wind. <em>Self-preservation and the fear instinct
alone form the source of all psychopathic maladies.</em></p>

<p>I adduce here a few cases which may be taken as
typical:</p>

<p>Mrs. M. C., aged thirty-two years. Family history
good; well developed physically and mentally.
A year before the present trouble set in, patient suffered
from a severe attack of grippe. Menstruation,
which was before painless and normal in
amount, became painful and scanty, accompanied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
by headaches, indisposition, irritability, crying
spells and backache which lasted long after the
menstrual period was over. The family physician
ascribed the symptoms to endometritis, mainly cervical
and treated her with absolute rest, fomentations,
injections, scarification and dilatation of the
cervix, and finally curetted the uterus. As the patient
grew worse under the treatment, she was
taken to a gynecologist, who after an examination
suggested an operation. The operation was duly
performed, with the result that the nervous symptoms
became intensified, and the attacks increased
in violence and duration. The turn of the nerve
specialist came next. Hysteria, neurasthenia, and
the more fashionable “psychasthenia” have been
diagnosed by various neurologists. A year of psychoanalysis
made of the patient a complete wreck, with
depression, introspection and morbid self-analysis.
Patient was put by neurologist under Weir
Mitchell’s treatment.</p>

<p>When the patient came under my care, she was
in mental agonies, a complete wreck. I gave up
the Weir Mitchell rest treatment, sent away the
nurse, released the patient from solitary bed confinement,
told her to leave the sick room, to give
up dieting and medicines, and to return to a normal,
active life. I kept on treating her by the hypnoidal
state. The patient began to improve rapidly, and
finally all her physical and mental symptoms disappeared;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
she has continued for over six years in
excellent condition of health.</p>

<p>A study of the case traced the fear instinct to
experiences of early childhood, fears accentuated
and developed into morbid states by the deleterious
tendencies of the treatment, giving rise to a
<em>somatopsychosis</em>, the physical symptoms mainly predominating.</p>

<p>A lady, aged fifty-nine years, suffered from kynophobia.
When about the age of twenty-nine years
she was bitten by a dog; since then she was afraid
of hydrophobia. She kept on reading in the papers
about cases of hydrophobia until the fear became
developed to an extraordinary degree and became
fixed and uncontrollable. According to the principles
of evolution of psychopathic states, the fear
kept on extending. The fear psychosis included all
objects that might possibly carry the germ of hydrophobia.
The neurosis became a mysophobia.</p>

<p>As in all other cases of psychopathic states the
psychosis was traced to the fear instinct, the germ
of which was laid in the patient’s early history. The
patient was a timid child, and was afraid of strange
animals. In the village where she lived there were
a few cases of hydrophobia which impressed her
when a child. This germ was in <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'later life developd'">later life developed</ins>
by thirty years’ cultivation.</p>

<p>Psychopathic or neurotic symptom complexes I
observed in children whose early training was favorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
to the awakening and development of the
fear instinct. In children affected with fear of animals
I traced the fear psychosis to the parents who
were afraid of animals, on account of actual
traumas in their life history, <em>the child being influenced
by imitation, by suggestion, often subconscious,
by the behavior of the parents in the presence
of animals</em>. Such children are predisposed to recurrent
psychopathic states.</p>

<p>In all such cases the etiology is easy to find, if
the patient is carefully examined. In many cases
the fear instinct with its symptom complex is associated
with external objects, giving rise to the
so-called phobias. Instead, however, of being associated
with external objects, the fear instinct is
frequently associated with somatic functions (pathophobia),
or with mental activities (phrenophobia).</p>

<p>Man, aged forty-seven years; actor; family
neurotic. Patient suffered from anorexia, indigestion,
choking, vomiting, gagging, eructation, gastralgia,
and occasional pains in the limbs. He led
a rather gay and irregular life up to the age of
thirty-two years, when he had syphilis, for which
he was under treatment for two years. This scared
him because he had the opportunity to see the
consequences of syphilis in many of his friends. He
had been under continual fear of the possibility
of development of parasyphilitic diseases.</p>

<p>Seven years ago, at the age of forty years, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
had to watch at the bedside of an intimate friend,
who had been suffering from severe gastric crises
of tabes dorsalis. After one specially exhausting
night of vigil, worry and fear, he went to bed for
a short nap and woke up with the idea of general
paresis and intense fear. From that time he began
to suffer from symptoms of tabes with fear of general
paresis.</p>

<p>The patient had been an imaginative child; he
had his fear instinct cultivated from early childhood
by stories of frights, scares, and horrible accidents.
When ten years old, his grandfather gave
<em>Faust</em> to him to read. Since then the patient was
troubled with the fear of selling his soul to Satan.
The patient was religious in his childhood, prayed
much, and was possessed by the fear of committing
sins. “It has now all come back,” he complained.
A great number of fears could be traced to his
early childhood. The somatic symptoms were the
manifestations of association of experiences of parasyphilitic
diseases, based on the pathological state
of the fear instinct, a case of pathophobia, a
somatopsychosis.</p>

<p>A few hypnoidal treatments effected a cure. The
patient returned to his occupation, free from any
distressing symptoms.</p>

<p>H. M. aged twenty-seven years, male, Canadian.
Family history good; looked pale, anemic, and frail;
very intelligent, sensitive, restless, and had a tendency<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
to worry. About a year ago, he began to
feel depressed, to worry about his health; thought
he suffered from tuberculosis. His physician assured
him that nothing was the matter, but he
had an uncontrollable fear of consumption; and the
idea kept on recurring. Up to the age of nineteen
years he was perfectly well. He was then laid up
with a sore knee for a few weeks. He had time
enough to brood over the knee, and read some literature
on the subject. He thought it was tuberculosis
and worried much. The knee, however, got
well, and gradually he forgot all about it, although
the idea of tuberculosis often made him feel uncomfortable,
and the idea of “water in the knee”
used to flash through his mind, to pass away the
next moment.</p>

<p>A year ago, however, he happened to lose his
work, became despondent, began to worry and to
brood over his financial troubles, slept restlessly,
suffered from anorexia, and began to lose flesh.
The idea of the knee and the fear of tuberculosis
got possession of him. He could not rid himself
of the idea of tuberculosis. If in the clinic the
physician assured him that he was all right, he
felt better for a couple of hours; but often it
did not last even as long as that. The least pain,
cough, heart beat, a feeling of chill or heat, and
the like, brought the idea and fear of tuberculosis
back to his mind with renewed energy. He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
obsessed by the fear of tuberculosis and felt he
was doomed to certain death, a psychosomatic
pathophobia.</p>

<p>Hypnoidal states did good service. The patient’s
mental condition began to improve rapidly. He
was no longer troubled with depression, insomnia,
and fears; began to gain in weight, appetite improved,
felt energy flowing in; began to look for
work in real earnest, finally found it, and kept at it.</p>

<p>Man, aged forty-three years, suffered from palpitation
of the heart, fainted easily, especially on
physical examination by physician, or at the beginning
of medical treatment. He suffered from
indigestion for which he had been under treatment
for a number of years by physicians who gave
him medicine for his bowels and also from time to
time kept on washing his stomach. He had a great
fear of becoming a victim of cardiac troubles, especially
of some unknown, terrible, valvular affection.
When under my care he kept on asking to be
taken to heart and stomach specialists, to be examined,
and have some radical operation performed.
Frequently under the influence of the fear states and
obsession of heart and stomach trouble, especially
the heart, he would collapse suddenly, be unable to
walk, and be afraid that he suffered from some
paralysis.</p>

<p>On examination the patient revealed a history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
full of various traumas which, from his very childhood
until he came under my care, helped to bring
about his psychopathic condition, and developed the
fear instinct to an extraordinary degree.</p>

<p>Physicians had the lion’s share in this special case
by their rearing of the fear instinct, and by their
favoring the patient’s phobias by their examinations,
by their prescriptions, and by the diet and treatment.
The patient was in such a panic that he
kept on taking his pulse on the least occasion, was
feeling his heart, stomach, and intestines at every
opportunity. The hypertrophied growth of his
morbid self and fear instinct had invaded and dominated
the patient’s whole personality, developed a
typical psychosomatic pathophobia with its recurrent
states. The patient was cured by hypnoidal
states.</p>

<p>In the <cite>Trudi</cite> for 1913 of the University of Moscow,
Russia, Doctor Ribakov made an extensive
study of a series of cases of psychopathic or psychoneurotic
asthma, and arrived at a conclusion similar
to my own, although he was no doubt unaware of
my work and publications on the same subject.
He came to the same conclusion as I that the
etiology of <em>neurosis is to be found in fear, which
alone forms the basis of psychopathic neurosis. All
other factors, social, professional, sexual, religious,
repressions, conflicts are only occasions of the disease.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
It is fear, and fear alone that forms the
pathology of the psychopathic neurotic symptom
complex.</em></p>

<p>A young lady was afflicted with ornithophobia,
fear of birds, fear of chickens. The sight of a
chicken set her into a panic. The patient is very
timid, and this timidity can be traced to her early
childhood. When at the age of six, a play-mate
threw a live chicken at her in the dark. The child
was terribly frightened, screamed, and fainted. The
mother used to tell her fairy stories full of adventure,
of ghosts, of dragons, and of monsters.
This prepared the patient to react so violently to
the sudden attack made by the flight, struggling,
and feel of the chicken in the dark. Since that time,
patient has formed an uncontrollable fear of live
birds.</p>

<p>Another patient of mine, a lady of forty-nine
years, single, suffered from potamophobia, a fear
of going into rivers, or into the ocean. When about
seven years old she was thrown into water by one
of her elder sisters. She was nearly drowned and
was half dead with fear when rescued. Since then
she has been in terror of water, or rather of rivers
and oceans. Several times she made conscious efforts
to get rid of the fear, but the attempts were
unsuccessful. In fact, the more she was forced or
forced herself consciously to get into the water,
the greater was the fear. This fear became all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
more intensified, when some of her intimate friends
were drowned in a boat. This fixed the fear which
became uncontrollable.</p>

<p>A patient of mine, a man of thirty-five years,
was afraid of going out in the dark. This was
traced to early associations of fears of the dark,
to superstitious beliefs in ghosts and spirits cultivated
in the patient’s early childhood. He was
afraid to remain alone in the dark or to go down
at night into cellars or other secluded places. This
fear was unfortunately still more intensified by an
accident. At the age of twenty-seven, one night
when returning late from a visit, he was assaulted
from behind by foot-pads. This accident fixed the
fear of darkness.</p>

<p>A lady of sixty-seven years, with pronounced
arteriosclerosis, had an attack of hemiplegia of the
left side. She suffered from motor aphasia, but did
not lose consciousness. The paralysis cleared up in
a few days, but the sudden attack demoralized her.
Since that time she is in terror of another attack.
She watches for symptoms, and the least sensation
of faintness throws her into a panic. The patient
is the wife of a general and was in China during
the Boxer riots, in the Spanish American war, in
the Philippines, and other military engagements.
The fear instinct was cultivated in her by all such
conditions.</p>

<p>In her early childhood there were fears and frights<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of child character, enough to arouse the fear instinct,
which was gradually developed and cultivated
by the circumstances of life and by worries
in the course of the various wars, of which she was
a witness. Finally the fear culminated by the stroke
of paralysis.</p>

<p>Similarly, I had patients who suffered from tuberculosis,
from asthma, from heart trouble, and from
all kinds of intestinal affections which specially
abound in psychopathic cases. All such cases can
be clearly traced to various somatic symptoms based
on the fear instinct. The etiology is fear, the
arousal and development of the fear instinct in respect
to the special symptom complex.</p>

<p>A patient, aged twenty-six years, suffered from
agoraphobia at various intervals. As a child of
nine years, he was attacked by rough boys. He
freed himself and ran in great terror. The boys
threatened him with another “licking” when he appeared
again on the street. He was afraid to go
out for several weeks. The parents forced him to
go and buy some things. Living in a rough neighborhood,
on account of his father’s circumstances,
he had been many times subjected to knocks, blows,
and assaults by rough boys, until the fear of the
open street became fixed into the well known form
of agoraphobia.</p>

<p>Another case, that of a lady of thirty-eight years,
married, suffers from ailurophobia, or fear of cats.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
This can be traced to the patient’s early childhood.
When she was a child her brothers and sisters
went through attacks of diphtheria, which was ascribed
to infection caused or transmitted by cats.
The patient was specially impressed with the danger
from cats. Under such training and suggestion
given in early childhood, the patient gradually
formed a fear of cats. This fear was still more
intensified and became a panic when she was put
into a dark room and a cat was let loose on the
poor victim by her mischievous companions, who
knew of the patient’s fear. When the patient had
children of her own, she was still more affected by
the fear of cats, on account of the subconscious and
conscious fear of the possibility of infection transmitted
by cats to her children.</p>

<p>All those cases were investigated and cured by
hypnoidal states.</p>

<p>Mr. D., a young man of twenty-five years, was
born in Poland. As far as can be ascertained, the
parents as well as the brothers and sisters are well.
A physical examination of the patient reveals nothing
abnormal. There are no sensory, no motor
disturbances. He complains of severe headaches,
preceded by a feeling of indisposition, depression,
vertigo and distress. During the attack there is
hyperesthesia to touch, pressure, temperature, and
to visual and auditory stimulations. <em>The patient
shivers and looks pale.</em> The cold experienced during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the attack is so intense that the patient has to
wrap himself in many blankets, as if suffering from
a malarial paroxysm.</p>

<p>Fears have strong possession of the patient’s
mind. He is afraid to remain in a closed place in
the daytime and especially at night. When he has
to remain alone at night, he is in an agony of fear,
and cannot go to sleep. Every passer-by is regarded
as a robber or murderer, and he quakes at the
least noise. When walking in the house in the dark,
he has the feeling as if someone were after him,
and occasionally even experiences the hallucination
of some one tugging at his coat. He is mortally
afraid of the dead and shuns a funeral. The patient
has also a fear of dogs, a kynophobia. The
fear is irresistible, and is as involuntary as a reflex.</p>

<p>An investigation, by means of the hypnoidal
states, brought out of the patient’s subconscious
life the following data: When a child of three years,
the patient lived with his family in a small village
near a large forest infested with wolves. In
one of the intermediary states a faint memory,
rather to say a vision, struggled up, a vision of
wolves and dogs. Some one cried out: “Run, wolves
are coming!” Crazed with fear, he ran into the
hut and fell fainting on the floor. It turned out
to be dogs instead of a pack of wolves. It is that
fright in early childhood which has persisted in
the subconscious mind, and, having become associated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
with subsequent experiences of attacks of dogs,
has found expression in the patient’s consciousness
as an instinctive fear of dogs.</p>

<p>But why was the patient in such abject terror
of dead people? This found its answer in the experiences
and training of his early life. When a
young child, the patient heard all kinds of ghost
stories, and tales of wandering lost souls and of
spirits of dead people hovering about the churchyard
and burial grounds; he heard tales of ghouls
and of evil spirits inhabiting deserted places, dwelling
in the graves of sinners and the wicked. He
listened to stories of haunted houses and of apparitions
stalking about in the dark. His social and
religious environment has been saturated with the
belief in the supernatural, as is usually the case
among the superstitious populations of Eastern
Europe. We cannot wonder, then, that an impressionable
child brought up under such conditions
should stand in mortal fear of the supernatural, especially
of the dead.</p>

<p>When the patient was about nine years old, his
parents noticed some prominences on his right chest.
It was suggested to them that the hand of a dead
person possessed the property of blighting life
and arresting all growth, and would, therefore,
prove a “powerful medicine” for undesirable
growths. It happened that an old woman in the
neighborhood died. The little boy was taken into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the room where the dead body was lying, and the
cold hand of the corpse was put on the child’s naked
chest. The little fellow fainted away in terror.
The fear of dead people became subconsciously fixed,
and manifested itself as an insistent fear of the
dead, and, in fact, of anything connected with the
dead and the world of spirits.</p>

<p>The patient had hardly recovered from the shock
of the “dead hand,” when he had to pass through a
still more severe experience. A party of drunken
soldiers, stationed in the little town, invaded his
house and beat his father unmercifully, almost crippled
him: they knocked down his mother, killed a
little brother of his, and he himself, in the very depth
of a winter night, dressed in a little shirt and coat,
made his escape to a deserted barn, where he passed
the whole night. He was nearly frozen when found
in the morning, crouching in a corner of the barn,
shivering with fear and cold.</p>

<p>From that time on the headaches manifested
themselves in full severity, with hyperesthesia and
death-like paleness and intense cold of the body.
The early cultivation of the fear instinct resulted in
a <em>neurosis</em> with its recurrent states.</p>

<p>Another patient is a man of thirty years; his
family history is good. He is physically well developed,
a well known professor of physics in one of
the foremost institutions in this country. He suffers
from attacks of loss of personality. The attack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
is of a periodical character, coming on at intervals
of two weeks, occasionally disappearing for a few
months, then reasserting itself with renewed energy
and vigor. During the attack the patient experiences
a void, a panic, which is sudden in its onset,
like <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit mal</i>. The trouble was diagnosed as larval
or psychic epilepsy; the man was referred to me
by Dr. Morton Prince as an extremely interesting,
but puzzling neurological case.</p>

<p>Patient feels that his “self” is gone. He can
carry on a conversation or a lecture during the
attack, so that no outsider can notice any change
in him, but his self is gone, and all that he does
and says, even the demonstration of a highly complex
problem in integral calculus is gone through
in an automatic way. The fury of the attack lasts
a few moments, but to him it appears of long
duration. He is “beside himself,” as he puts it.
He seems to stand beside himself and watch his body,
“the other fellow,” as he describes it, carry on
the conversation or the lecture. He is “knocked
out of his body, which carries on all those complicated
mental processes.” For days after he
must keep on thinking of the attack, feels scared
and miserable, thinking insistently, in great agony,
over his awful attack, <em>a recurrent psychoneurotic
phrenophobia</em>.</p>

<p>At first the patient could trace this attack only
as far back as his seventh year. Later on, earlier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
experiences of childhood came to light, and then it
became clear that the <em>attack developed out of the
primitive instinctive fear of early childhood</em>, fear
of the unfamiliar, fear of the dark, of the unknown,
of the mysterious, fears to which he had been subjected
in his tender years.</p>

<p>This state was further reinforced by the early
death of his parents, it was hammered in and fixed
by hard conditions of life, full of apprehension and
anxiety. Life became to the child one big mysterious
fear of the unknown. The fear instinct
formed the pathological focus of the attack. As
the patient puts it: “It is the mystical fear of the
attacks which overpowers me.”</p>

<p>With the disintegration of the focus the symptom
complex of the attacks disappeared. The patient
is in excellent condition, he is doing brilliant work
in physics and chemistry and is professor in one
of the largest universities in Canada.</p>

<p>I present another case apparently “paranoidal,”
a case interesting from our standpoint. The patient
is a man of twenty-seven years; his parents
are neurotic, religious revivalists. As far back
as the age of eight he suffered from agonizing fears
of perdition and scares of tortures in hell, impressed
on his sensitive, young mind during the revivals. He
is very religious, obsessed with the fear of having
committed an unpardonable sin. He thinks he is
damned to suffer tortures in hell for all eternity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
He keeps on testing any chance combinations, and
if his guesses turn out correct, he is wrought up
to a pitch of excitement and panic. For to him
it means a communication coming from an unseen
world of unknown mysterious powers. With his condition
diagnosed as “paranoidal dementia praecox,”
the patient was committed to an insane asylum,
from which he was subsequently released.</p>

<p>The attack comes in pulses of brief duration, followed
by long periods of brooding, depression, and
worry. The primitive fear of pain, of danger and
death, and the sense of the mysterious cultivated
by his religious training, reached here an extraordinary
degree of development. Among the earliest
memories that have come up in the hypnoidal state
was the memory of a Sunday school teacher, who
cultivated in the patient, then but five years of
age, those virulent germs which, grown on the soil
of the primitive instinctive fear and the highly developed
sense of the unknown and the mysterious,
have brought forth poisonous fruits which now
form the curse of his life. The case is a typical
<em>psychoneurotic phrenophobia</em> with its characteristic
recurrent states.</p>

<p>“It is difficult,” the patient writes, “to place the
beginning of my abnormal fear. It certainly
originated from doctrines of hell which I heard in
early childhood, particularly from a rather ignorant
teacher who taught Sunday school. My early religious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
thought was chiefly concerned with the direful
eternity of torture that might be awaiting me,
if I was not good enough to be saved.”</p>

<p>After a couple of years of persistent treatment
by means of the hypnoidal state and by methods
of association and disintegration of the active subconscious
systems, the patient recovered. He entered
a well known medical school and took the foremost
rank among the medical students.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><em>In the investigation or psychognosis of psychopathic
cases I invariably find the psychopathology
to be a morbid condition of the fear instinct, rooted
in the primordial impulse of self-preservation.</em> The
psychognosis of this underlying pathological state
and disintegration of the latter are of the utmost
consequence in the domain of psychopathology and
psychotherapeutics.</p>

FEAR CONFESSIONS</h2>


<p>A few “Confessions” made by psychopathic sufferers
will help us best to understand the character,
the mechanism, the factors, and principles of neurosis:</p>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>“As you are desirous of knowing more about
my life and environment, I state concerning them
as follows:</p>

<p>“You will remember that I told you that my step-father
was a liquor dealer. Throughout all the
time that he was in business we either lived over
the bar-room or else right in the place where the
liquor was sold. My step-father was a very heavy
drinker, a man of violent nature, and decidedly
pugnacious. As a child I have been scared to death
by drunken brawls, and many nights have been
dragged out of bed by my mother who would flee with
me to the house of a neighbor for safety.</p>

<p>“I might say that until I was seventeen years
old, I lived in continual terror of something going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
to happen. If he was arrested by the police, as
often happened, our home would be a scene of turmoil
until the case was settled.</p>

<p>“I remember one incident very plainly, when he
came home one night completely covered with blood
as the result of being held up by thugs, and another
time when he left the house to subdue some quarreling
drunks with a pistol and returned after an
exchange of shots with his hand shot through.</p>

<p>“As a child, I was inclined to study, and associated
very little with other children. My mother
tells me that I talked early, but when about three
years old I began to stammer. This trouble
bothered me a great deal, and I used to worry about
it all the time, especially in school when I would
try to recite. I might add that even now, when
excited, I am troubled in the same way.</p>

<p>“My step-father has been subject to nightmares
nearly all his life; when asleep he would cry and
moan and would be unable to move until some one
would shake him out of it. He was terribly afraid
of them, and I remember he used to say that he
expected to die in one of them. I used to be left
alone with him quite frequently, and I stood in
constant fear of his dying; and if he fell asleep,
as he frequently did in the day time, I would wake
him or watch his respiration to see if he was alive.</p>

<p>“At other times I have been awakened in the night
by his cries and would assist my mother in bringing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
him to consciousness. It was during one of
these times that I became aware of my heart palpitating,
and whenever he had such a spell, I would
be in a state of fear and excitement for some time
after. He would have these nightmares nearly every
night and some times four or five times in one night,
and I might add that he has them even now.</p>

<p>“I began to have attacks of dizziness in the
streets, and finally one day, I had one, and all symptoms
and fears of the attack came on in school, and
from that time on I have watched my respiration
and suffered from dizziness, mental depression, and
sadness.</p>

<p>“You have asked me to tell you more in detail
about the attacks or nightmares to which my step-father
was subject, and which always frightened
me greatly, especially when a child.</p>

<p>“My step-father had the habit of falling asleep
quite often, even in the day time, and I have never
known him to go to sleep without having an attack
in some form. If one watched him asleep, as I
often did, one could tell by his respiration when an
attack was coming. His breathing would become
slower and hardly perceptible, and finally he would
begin to moan, and cry out; then, when shaken
vigorously and spoken to, he would awaken in great
fear and apparent suffering. If he had an attack,
and we did not respond soon enough, he would be
very angry and say that we cared not if he should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
die. We were so afraid of these attacks that we had
trained ourselves to be ever on the look-out for his
cries, even at night.</p>

<p>“It really seemed as if his life rested in our hands.
I might say that sometimes these attacks lasted several
minutes, before he could be awakened. He used
to say that at such times he always dreamed someone
was choking, beating, or otherwise torturing
him. He had been told by some physician that he
would ultimately die in such an attack.</p>

<p>“These attacks were sufficient to precipitate a
small panic in the house. I know not a single hour
of the day or night, but that I have either been
called or awakened by my mother in her efforts
to awaken him. With the attack over, I would be
trembling all over, and my heart would be beating
madly. I can remember these attacks from my
earliest childhood, and it seems to me that on one
occasion, at your office, I was startled just as these
attacks used to make me.”</p>

<p>While in the hypnoidal state, patient exclaimed:
“I am afraid. All my life I lived under terror....
This is just my disease,&mdash;fear.”</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>“I lived from infancy in a state of apprehension
and fear. In my home there seemed to be always a
tension. I don’t know that I ever relaxed there during
my waking hours. I was never at peace mentally.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
This was largely brought about by my mother’s
chronic condition of fear. I should not have had
such a large development of the fear habit had there
been any neutralizing influence. But my father was
a weak character, living under fear, being afraid of
responsibility, so that my character was closely
molded on his. He gave me no moral fiber to resist
fears of mother, and so did not help me to build any
character of my own. I still carry with me the state
of apprehension and fear that I contracted in my
early life. I had only one serious illness in my life
outside of my nervous troubles. Had an attack of
bowel trouble somewhere near the age of six. I was
once struck in the face by a dog’s teeth. I have
had various cancer experiences.</p>

<p>“My father, when I was very young, had some irritation
of the throat. A physician told him he was
in danger of cancer. I can recall him anxiously
looking at his throat. Later a neighbor went to a
‘plaster specialist’ to have a supposed cancer of
the tongue removed. His wife was often at our
home talking of his sufferings.</p>

<p>“While attending dental school I contracted some
trouble. I went to a physician near where I lived.
He talked to me of a possibility of syphilis. I
became much frightened, and read all I could find on
syphilis. The books scared me still more. At last
on the advice of friends, I went to another physician
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'who reasurred me'">who reassured me</ins>, and I lost part of my fear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>“After this I returned home for a summer vacation.
This was in 1904. That summer my tongue
felt sore, I looked at it, and found it peculiar. This
aroused my fears of syphilis. Upon returning to
Chicago in the fall (1904) I asked my physician to
recommend a specialist. He sent me to a syphilographer,
who told me I had no syphilis, but that
the condition of my tongue was caused by gall bladder
trouble. He wished me to have the gall bladder
operated which I refused to do. I thought no more
about my tongue until I studied cancer in oral surgery.
I would then occasionally worry over my
condition. About this time an actor whom I knew
died of cancer of the tongue. I worried over my
tongue, being afraid of cancer, for several days
after this. I then went along for seven or eight
years without much thought of my tongue.</p>

<p>“One day in February 1913, after some pain in my
side which brought the thoughts of gall bladder and
then of the tongue, I asked advice of a physician.
He looked at my tongue and said: ‘I don’t wish to
frighten you, but you should have that tongue
attended to. You might some day have a cancer
there.’ He sent me to a throat specialist who said
the condition of my tongue was due to a back tooth.
I had the tooth removed. I afterwards consulted
Dr. L., a surgeon at Eau Claire, Wis., with the idea
of having the gall bladder operated upon. He
laughed at the gall bladder trouble, but sent me to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
Battle Creek Sanitarium with the idea, I think, that
the change would relieve me of my fears. At Battle
Creek I was told I had a mild case of colitis, and was
put under treatment for it.</p>

<p>“While at Battle Creek my fears grew less. I remained
at Battle Creek about two months. Shortly
before leaving there I was given a Wasserman test.
This they told me was faintly positive. I was then
given three injections of Neo-Salvarsan. I then left
Battle Creek and stopped at Chicago to see Dr. P.
Dr. P. said any Wasserman would be positive, taken
with no more care than mine had been. That there
was no reason to think there was any syphilis anyway.
He then sent me to Dr. W., an internist, who
said I had hyperacidity of the stomach.</p>

<p>“I did not feel very badly at this time, although
my fears of cancer persisted. I was carrying on the
work in my office. Later in the summer I went to
the Mayo Clinic at Rochester, Minn., where I was
given a local application for my tongue. In the fall
of 1913, while in Milwaukee I consulted an oral surgeon,
Dr. B. He said ‘I will send you to Dr. F., a
dermatologist who knows more about diseases of the
tongue than any man I know.’ I consulted Dr. F.
who said: ‘Geographical tongue, do not worry about
it.’ My fears were instantly relieved. I seldom
thought of my tongue in the next two years.</p>

<p>“In the fall of 1916 I had some trouble with my
stomach. This seemed to bring my fears to mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and one day my fear of cancer returned. There
was a connection between my fears and the stomach
and gall bladder trouble diagnosed in regard to my
tongue. At least the stomach trouble would bring
thoughts of the tongue condition.</p>

<p>“I tried to help myself out of my mental condition
by reading articles on cancer. This made me worse.
I went to Chicago where I was told by Dr. S., a dermatologist,
that radium might remedy the condition
of my tongue. I had several applications of radium.
After this I still worried a great deal. I went
through the spring and summer under a nervous
strain, but still able to carry on my work. That
fall (1917) I had such intense fear that I was
attacked by acute insomnia. I was unable to sleep
without Veronal. The day after my insomnia began
I found myself very weak. I was pale, and my heart
would pound on the least exertion. I had also a
great deal of pain in my bowels. I went to Chicago
and consulted Dr. E., Dean of Northwestern University
Medical School. He told me such conditions
usually traveled in a circle, that my nervous condition
might leave me in a few months. I went
through the winter in this condition.</p>

<p>“I began to have a great fear of the fact that it
was necessary to use hypnotics. This fear of drugs
was strong, and overshadowed my other fears. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
read an article on hypnotics as a habit; this added
to my fear of them.</p>

<p>“Before using hypnotics I noticed my sexual
power was less, or rather there was no pleasure in it.
This did not trouble me as I thought it a part of my
nervous condition.</p>

<p>“In April, 1918, I went again to Battle Creek. I
did very well there for a week, but then got into a
deep depression, became weak, and was frightened to
think I was no better. I remained in Battle Creek
for three weeks, and then went home. A month
later I went to St. Paul and consulted a neurologist.
He did not know what to do for me.</p>

<p>“I went to Milwaukee and consulted another
neurologist. I was becoming more despondent all
the time. I decided to go to a sanitarium to see if
I could not get rid of my drug habit. I went to
Wauwatosa, Wis., and remained there three weeks,
but I could see they did not know what to do for me.</p>

<p>“In August I entered the Rest Hospital at Minneapolis
and remained there for a while under the care
of Dr. J. I managed to drag along, terrorized by
my condition and by the fact that I could get no
relief.</p>

<p>“The drug habit was my greatest obsession at this
time. I used bromides and chloral hydrate,&mdash;changed
hypnotics frequently.</p>

<p>“In January, 1919, I saw Dr. P. of Chicago, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
sent me to a sanitarium where I received no help.
I then hunted through magazines for articles on
nervous diseases. I read of Dr. S. and his work and
came under his care at Portsmouth in May, 1919.
While there I learned to control my fears. I left
Portsmouth in August feeling sure of myself. I
would occasionally have a depression which would
not frighten me and did not remain with me long. I
was looking forward to a happy future.</p>

<p>“During the summer of 1921 I felt tired most of
the time. However, I was still sure of being able to
handle myself. One day after feeling very tired my
fear of cancer returned. I got into a panic and
started East to see Dr. S. On arriving in Boston I
found he was in the West. I went to Dr. P.’s office;
was sent to Dr. W. and by him to a psycho-analyst.
The psycho-analyst said I had a ‘mother complex,
without usual sexual features.’ Psycho-analysis
proved a failure, and I abandoned the treatment with
disgust, as useless and silly.”</p>

<p>The patient was under my care for five months.
He is now back to his dental work. He writes to me
that he is gaining rapidly in weight, and is in excellent
condition.</p>


<h3>III</h3>

<p>“I am a married woman of fifty-two. All my life I
have been imprisoned in the dungeon keep of fear.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
Fear paralyzes me in every effort. If I could once
overcome my enemy, I would rejoice forever more.</p>

<p>“In childhood everything cowered me. I was bred
in fear. At five or six my mother died, and I feared
and distrusted a God who would so intimidate me and
bereave me. I heard tales of burglars being discovered
hiding under beds, and a terrified child retired
nightly for years. I was in agony of fears.
My fears I never told. Later I heard of the doctrines
of God’s foreknowledge, and, as a little rebel,
I would place dishes on the pantry shelves, changing
from place to place, and then giving up in despair,
knowing that if foreknowledge were true, God knew
that I would go through with all that performance.</p>

<p>“Through childhood I feared suicide. It was a
world of escape that appealed to me and yet appalled
me. I also heard of somnambulism, and I never saw
a keen bladed knife, but I dreaded that in my sleep
I might do damage to myself or to my friends in a
state of unconsciousness.</p>

<p>“In my twenties I did attempt suicide a number
of times, but somehow they proved unsuccessful. I
always aimed to have it appear an accident. I
dreaded to have my death appear as a stain and disgrace
to my family which I loved.</p>

<p>“I always fear to walk at any height, on a trestle
over running walls, or even to walk on a bridge without
side railings.</p>

<p>“As a child I was afraid of the dark, I was afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
of going out on the street in a dark night. In fact,
even a moonlight night terrified me when I remained
alone. I was afraid to go into dark places, such as
cellars, or into lonely places even in the daytime.</p>

<p>“As a child I was always shy, fearful, timid, and
self-conscious to a painful degree. Even as a grown-up
woman I am often a sufferer from the same cause,
although I have sufficient self-control to conceal it.</p>

<p>“I have to be careful of my state of health, as the
latter is very delicate. I am a chronic sufferer from
indigestion and constipation, although I somehow
manage to regulate these troubles.</p>

<p>“When I need my nerves in good control so frequently,
they are in a state of utter collapse. My
brain is in a state of confusion, in a state of whirl
just when I need to think the clearest. My poor
brain feels as if a tight band encircled and contracted
it. It seems to me as if the brain has
shrunken from the temples.</p>

<p>“My memory is unreliable. Often I read quite
carefully, but I am unable to recall what I have read.
Especially is this so, if called upon without previous
warning. My brain goes into a panic of an extremely
alarming kind.</p>

<p>“I was told that I was a woman of a good brain
and of great talent, that all I needed was to exercise
my will and determination, and that I would succeed.
I lack concentration and I lack confidence.</p>

<p>“In my childhood hell fire was preached. Fore-ordination<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
and an arbitrary God were held up to my
childish comprehension. I was bred in fear, and self
destruction resulted.”</p>


<h3>IV</h3>

<p>The following valuable account given by an
eminent physician brings out well the factors and
principles of neurosis expounded in this volume:</p>

<p>“You ask me to write about my fears. I give you
a brief account.</p>

<p>“As a child, as far as memory carries, I had a
fear of ghosts, of giants, of monsters, and of all
kinds of mysterious and diabolical agencies and
witchcraft of which I had heard a number of tales
and stories in my early childhood. I was afraid of
thieves, of robbers, and of all forms of evil agencies.
The fears were stronger at daytime, but more so at
night. Strange noises, unexpected voices and sounds
made a cold shiver run down my back.</p>

<p>“I was afraid to remain alone in a closed room,
or in the dark, or in a strange place. It seemed to
me as if I was left and abandoned by everybody, and
that something awful was going to happen to me.
When I happened to be left alone under such conditions
I was often in a state of helplessness, paralyzing
terror. Such states of fear sweep occasionally
over me even at present. I find, however, that they
are far more complicated with associations of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
more developed personal life. I know that in some
form or other the fears are present, but are inhibited
by counteracting impulses and associations. I still
feel a cold shiver running down my back, when I
happen to go into a dark cellar in the dead of night,
or happen to remain alone in a dark, empty house.
Such fears date back to my fourth year, and possibly
to an earlier time of my childhood.</p>

<p>“As a matter of contrast-inhibitions of such fears
I may either brace myself and put myself in a state
of courage and exaltation, or when this does not
succeed, I let my mind dwell on other fears and troubles.
I find that the last method is often far more
effective in the inhibition of fear states which at the
moment are present with me. All I need is to press
the button, so to say, and awaken some other fears,
the present fears diminish in intensity, and fade
away for the time being. I actually favor, and welcome,
and even look for disagreeable and painful
experiences so as to overcome some of my present
fears. The new fears are then treated in the same
way.</p>

<p>“As I became older, about the age of eight, I
began to fear disease and death. This may be due
to the infectious diseases that attacked many members
of our family, about this time. In fact, I have
been present at the death bed of some of them, and
the impression was one of terror, mysterious horror.
I was afraid I might get diseases from which I might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
die. After my witnessing the last agonizing moment
of death, my elders thought of removing me to a
safer place; their fears and precautions still more
impressed the fear of danger of disease and death.
I may say that I really never freed myself from the
fear of disease and death. The latter fear is
always present with me in a vague form, always
ready to crop up at any favorable opportunity.
This fear, in so far as it is extending its tentacles
in various directions, is often the bane of my life.
Even at my best there is always a kind of vague
fear of possible danger, lurking in various objects
which may be infected or possibly poisonous.</p>

<p>“This fear has been spreading and has become
quite extensive, involving my family, my children,
my friends, my acquaintances, and my patients.
Usually I ignore these fears, or get control over
them by an effort of will. When, however, I happen
to be fatigued, or worried over small things in the
course of my work, or happen to be in low spirits
by petty reversals of life, these fears may become
aroused. Under such conditions I may become
afraid, for instance, of drinking milk, because it may
be tuberculous.</p>

<p>“This fear may spread and involve fear for my
children and my patients; or again I may be afraid
of eating oysters and other shell fish, because they
may be infected with typhoid fever germs. I may
refuse to eat mushrooms, because they may be poisonous.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
The other day I was actually taken sick
with nausea and with disposition to vomiting after
eating of otherwise good mushrooms. The fear
seized on me that they all might be poisonous ‘toadstools.’
Such fears may extend to ever new reactions
and to ever new associations, and are possibly the
worst feature of the trouble.</p>

<p>“I have a fear of coming in contact with strangers,
lest I get infected by them, giving me tuberculosis,
influenza, scarlet fever, and so on. This mysophobia
involves my children and my friends, inasmuch that
I am afraid that strangers may communicate some
contagious diseases. A similar fear I have in regard
to animals, that they may possibly be infected with
rabies, or with glanders, or with some other deadly,
pathogenic micro-organism. I am afraid of mosquito
bites, lest they give me malaria, or yellow fever. The
fears, in the course of their extension, may become
ever more intense and more insidious than the original
states.</p>

<p>“As a child I had some bad experiences with dogs;
I was attacked by dogs and badly bitten. Although
this fear is no longer so intense as it was in
my childhood, still I know it is present. My heart
sometimes comes to a sudden standstill, when I happen
to come on a strange dog. When the strange
dog growls and barks, all my courage is lost, and I
beat an inglorious retreat. It is only in the presence
of other people that I can rise to the effort of walking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
along and apparently paying no attention to the
dog. This is because I fear the opinion of others
more even than I fear the growls of dogs. My social
and moral fears are far greater than my purely
physical fears.</p>

<p>“When I became older, about the age of eighteen
to twenty, a new form of fear appeared, like a new
sprout added to the main trunk, or possibly growing
out of the main fear of disease and death, that is the
fear of some vague, impending evil. The fear of
some terrible accident to myself and more so to my
family, or to any of the people of whom I happen
to take care, is constantly present in the margin of
my consciousness, or as you would put it, in my subconsciousness.
Sometimes the fears leave me for a
while, sometimes they are very mild, and sometimes
again they flare up with an intensity that is truly
alarming and uncontrollable. The energy with which
those fears become insistent in consciousness, and
the motor excitement to which they give rise are
really extraordinary. The fear comes like a sudden
flood. The energy with which those fears rise into
consciousness is often overwhelming.</p>

<p>“Fear gets possession of me under circumstances
in which my suspicions are, for some reason or other,
aroused to activity, all the more so if the suspicions
of possible impending evil are awakened suddenly.
In other words, the fears arise with stimulations of
associations of threatening danger to myself and to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
my family. I am afraid that something may happen
to my children; I fear that they may fall sick suddenly;
I fear that some terrible accident may happen
to them; I fear that they may fall down from
some place, and be maimed or be killed. I fear that
my children and other members of my family may
be poisoned by people who are not well disposed
towards them. I am afraid that they may pick up
some food that was infected, or that they may be
infected in school by children who happen to suffer
from some infectious maladies. I am afraid that my
children may be overrun by some vehicles, by automobiles,
or that they may be killed in an accident,
that they may be killed by a street car, or even that
the house may collapse. This latter event has actually
taken place when I was a child. In fact, many,
if not all of those fears have actually their origin in
my experience.</p>

<p>“As I write you these lines, memories of such events
come crowding upon my mind. Are they the noxious
seeds that have been planted on the soil of fear?
I am afraid sometimes that even the food I and my
children as well as other people eat may give rise
to toxic products and thus produce disease. Often
in the dead of night, I may come to see my children
in order to convince myself that they have no fever,
and that they are not threatened by any terrible
disease. The very words ‘sickness,’ ‘disease,’ ‘not
feeling well,’ ‘death,’ arouse my feeling and sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
throw me into a panic. I am afraid to use such
words in connection with any of my children. I am
afraid that the evil mentioned may actually happen.</p>

<p>“When a child I learned about testing and omens.
If a test comes through in a certain way, it is an
omen of good luck, otherwise it means bad luck.
This superstitious testing and omens have remained
with me, and that in spite of my liberal training and
knowledge of the absurdity of such superstitions.
I may test by opening the Bible at any page, or I
may test by anything that might occur, according
to my guesses. All of these fears I know have no
meaning for me, they are senseless and absurd, but
they are so rooted in my early childhood, they have
been so often repeated, they have accumulated round
them so much emotion of fear that they come to my
mind with a force which is truly irresistible. Many
of the fears have multiplied to such an extent that
I cannot touch anything without rousing some slumbering
fear.</p>

<p>“To continue with my fears; I am often afraid
that the doors are not well locked, and I must try
them over and over again; I go away and come back
again, and try and try again, and once more. It is
tiresome, but as the fear is constantly with me, and
is born again and again, I cannot be satisfied, and
must repeat the whole process over and over until I
get tired, and give up the whole affair in sheer
despair. In such cases a contrary and different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
fear comes in handy. One devil banishes another.
I am afraid that the gas jet is left open, and I must
try it over and over, and test the jets with matches.
This process of testing may go on endlessly. The
fear remains and the process must begin again until
it is stopped by sheer effort of will as something
meaningless, automatic, and absurd. The performance
must be stopped and substituted by something
else.</p>

<p>“Colds, or attacks of influenza of the mildest
character have given rise to fears of pneumonia.
Pain in the abdomen, or a little intestinal distress
has awakened fears of possible appendicitis, or of
tumor, or intestinal obstruction. The least suspicion
of blood in the stools awakens the fear of possible
cancer. Vomiting or even nausea brings fears
of cancer of the stomach. There is no disease from
which I have not suffered.</p>

<p>“The same fears have naturally been extended to
my children, and to all those who are under my care.
The least symptom is sufficient to arouse in me
fears of possible terror and horrible consequences.</p>

<p>“I am afraid that suits may be brought against
me, or that some of my own people, patients and even
employees whom I discharged, may bring legal action
against me in court, or blackmail me. When I leave
home, I am afraid that something terrible has happened.
The fear of impending evil is always with
me. The fears have invaded every part of my being.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
It seems as if there is no resistance in my mind to
those terrible fear states.</p>

<p>“Perhaps it may interest you to know that, although
I am quite liberal, and even regarded as irreligious,
still I am afraid to express any word against
God, Christ, saints, martyrs of any church and denomination,
be they Christian, Mohammedan, Buddhist,
or pagan. I am afraid lest they may hear me
and do me harm; I fear to say a word even against
the devil or Satan. I am obsessed by fears. Fears
pursue me as long as I am awake, and do not leave
me alone in my sleep and dreams. Fears are the
curse of my life, and yet I have control of them, none
but you has any suspicion of them. I go about my
work in a seemingly cheerful and happy way. The
fears, however, are the bane of my life, and torture
me by their continued presence.</p>

<p>“I tried to find whether or not those fears had any
relation to my wishes or to my sexual experiences.
I must say that I find they bear no relation whatever
to wish or sex. My mental states grow on fear,
take their origin in fear, and feed on fear. Fear is
the seed and the soil of all those infinite individual
phobias that keep on torturing me unless opposed
by a supreme effort of my will.</p>

<p>“Truly the Biblical curse well applies to my life.</p>

<p>“‘The Lord will make thy plagues wonderful, and
the plagues of thy seed, even great plagues, and of
long continuance, and sore sickness, and of long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
continuance. Moreover, he will bring upon thee all
the diseases of Egypt, which thou wast afraid of,
and they shall cleave unto thee. And every sickness
and every plague, which is not written in the book of
this law, them will the law bring upon thee, until thou
be destroyed. Thou shalt find no ease, neither shall
the sole of thy foot have rest; but the Lord shall
give thee a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and
sorrow of mind. And thy life shall hang in doubt
before thee, and thou shalt fear day and night and
shall have none assurance of thy life. In the morning
thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and
at even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning!
for the fear of thine heart wherewith thou shalt
fear....’</p>

<p>“I laid bare my soul before you. I permit you
to do with this document whatever you may think
fit.”</p>


<h3>V</h3>

<p>“I was born of healthy parents; grand-parents
were also healthy. All lived to a ripe old age, and
died of natural causes. Father is still living; I was
a healthy normal child with little sickness up to the
age of 16. A few years prior I belonged to a gymnasium
and enjoyed superb physical strength and
health, though I was from childhood somewhat of a
coward. I then became associated with some youngsters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
who liked night life. This association influenced
me to join them in their nightly escapades.</p>

<p>“Between overtaxing myself in my work and trying
to keep up with the boys socially my system was
drained. This was kept up for about five years. I
was working for a dry cleaning establishment the
owner of which did not appreciate my hard work.
I gave ten hours a day service, but he required even
more, so that I spent as many as fifteen and eighteen
hours a day, and kept that up for about five
years.</p>

<p>“It was in January, 1911, at the age of twenty
while sitting in a restaurant eating my lunch, I felt
a strange sensation coming over me, such as blood
rushing to my head, followed by weakness, trembling,
and fainting spells. I summoned up what will power
I had left, shook my head in effort to brace up, and
tried to finish my meal, but without success. I left
the restaurant and coming outside felt the same sensation.
I leaned against a building, and my knees
gave way from under me until I was compelled to lie
down. I made an attempt to get up, boarded a
street car, and started for my father’s store which
was about a mile down the street. As I stepped on
the platform I felt the same spell coming over me.
Some of the men standing on the back platform saw
my condition, and helped me. I arrived at the store
where I collapsed.</p>

<p>“An ambulance was called, and I was taken to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
city hospital. The interne diagnosed the case as
acute indigestion. He prescribed some soda tablets,
and told me to be careful with my diet. I felt relieved
at what he told me, because I thought it was
not so serious as I had expected. For I thought the
end was near. My brother who accompanied me
spoke kind and encouraging words which soothed
my nerves.</p>

<p>“On the street car my thoughts started to go over
the whole of what had occurred. I could not control
myself and gave way again. When I got home
I could not eat. I lay down and tried to get some
sleep, but sleep was out of the question. My
thoughts always wandered back to these spells, and
that would bring back another spell. I took the
tablets prescribed by the physician, but they did not
help me any.</p>

<p>“The next day I tried to go to work, but could
not on account of these spells. I then decided to call
our family physician. He told me it was a nervous
breakdown, and prescribed bromides. I kept on having
these spells in spite of the bromides. I was at a
loss what to do. From then on I became afraid to
venture anywhere, to go to any place, for fear of
these spells. My real trouble began. I was afraid
to live, and afraid to die, afraid to go out, afraid
to lie down, always afraid of these spells.</p>

<p>“I remained at home for a couple of weeks, but the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
spells continued. I then decided to try another doctor.
This time a stomach specialist, and as might
be expected he claimed my stomach was the cause of
my disturbances. The news was gratifying to me.
I knew that stomach troubles could be cured, and
the thought helped to quiet some of the fears. I
went back to work after a few weeks. The belief in
the efficacy of the drug enabled me to get down town
to work, but I kept on having spells, losing weight,
and feeling miserable.</p>

<p>“I decided to try another physician. This time a
nerve specialist. After examination he diagnosed
the case as nervous prostration. He gave me what
he called a good nerve tonic. In addition to it he
used to stripe my back with red hot instruments. I
was under this doctor’s care for about a year. I
kept on going to work whenever I could, but the
spells continued right along, at home in the night, or
at work in the daytime. After a year of treatment
I felt no better.</p>

<p>“I decided to try another nerve specialist,&mdash;his
diagnosis was depletion of the nerves. He advised
me to come in a couple of times a week for electric
treatment. I followed instructions for a couple of
months, but the spells continued just the same.</p>

<p>“One April day there was an electric storm. The
lightning caused in me a great dread and fear. The
wind broke some of the windows in our house. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
had then the worst spell. I lost consciousness.
When I awoke I was worse than ever. I was just
choked up with tear of everything and everybody.</p>

<p>“I found I could no longer live in C., for the last
bit of life was ebbing right out of me. I started on
the train for Los Angeles. No one can realize the
suffering I had to endure on my trip out West.</p>

<p>“Everybody on the train talked about accidents,
wrecks, and robberies. After arriving in Los Angeles
I felt somewhat relieved, but the spells kept on
just the same. I consulted a great nerve specialist
in Los Angeles. He claimed I had neurasthenia, and
that I was much run down. His method of therapy
was different from the rest. He suggested renting
a cottage along the ocean front, and he would furnish
a trainer whose wife was to take care of the cottage.
The trainer was supposed to have some knowledge
of physical culture and massage. After being
in this camp for three months I saw no improvement
in my condition.</p>

<p>“I went to another doctor who employed a different method.
He would inject pig serum into my
arm three times a week. After a thorough trial I
found no relief.</p>

<p>“I then decided to try Christian Science for a
while, but I had no relief from all my woe and misery.
(When asked why he went to Christian Science while
he was of Jewish faith, he replied that he was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
such a state of fear that had he been ordered to be
a cockroach he would have tried to become one).</p>

<p>“I tried another nerve doctor. After a while
it was the same old story. I then tried chiropractice.
After three months’ trial I found out that I
had to give it up, because the manipulator aggravated
my condition. Towards the end I felt such
pains in my back and spine that I was compelled to
lie in bed for a week before I could recover enough
strength to sit up. I then tried Osteopathy. I felt
no better, so I had to abandon that.</p>

<p>“In search for health I could not stop here, so I
went to another nerve specialist who after examination
claimed to have discovered something different
from any other physician. He discovered I had a
pair of tonsils in my mouth which did not look well to
him. He ordered them removed; that meant an operation
under an anesthetic. Can you imagine my
feeling when he told me the news? I had a terrible
time in making up my mind what to do. Bad as I
felt I made up my mind that I might as well die
under ether as in any other way. I consented to the
operation. It is needless to go into details here of
what took place after the operation. Words cannot
express it. All the tortures of hell would have been
paradise towards what I went through after this
operation.</p>

<p>“I have been going since from physician to physician,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
each one claiming that I haven’t been to the
right one, and that he was the proper physician who
understood my case and could cure me. No one has
been able to effect a cure.”</p>

<p>As an example of the patient’s state of extreme
fear the following instance may be given. One day
he came to me, a picture of misery and depression.
He told me he had suffered agonies for the last
couple of days, on account of an “ingrowing hair.”
It turned out that the patient overheard a conversation
among his gossips, that some one died of an
“ingrowing hair.” This news strongly impressed
him, and aroused his fear instinct, since he discovered
an “ingrowing hair” on his throat. I found his
throat was wrapped around with cotton, and covered
with adhesive plaster. On unwrapping the mess I
found just an ordinary little pimple. I threw away
the wrappings, and gave the patient a scolding, and
ridiculed him for his silliness. He felt as he said in
“paradise.” A competent observer will find this
trait of trivial fears, characteristic, in various degrees,
of every psychopathic patient.</p>

<p>By a series of trance states the patient was freed
from his psycholeptic fear attacks; he is now in good
health, and attending successfully to his business.</p>

<br />
FEAR TRANCE APPARITIONS</h2>


<p>The following study of a psychopathic case
brings out the character of the fear trance dream.</p>

<p>Mrs. A. is twenty-two years old; Russian; married.
She suffers periodically from attacks of violent
headaches, lasting several days. Family history
is good. The patient was brought up in the fear of
ghosts, evil spirits, magical influences, and diabolical
agencies. Mrs. A. is easily frightened, and has
suffered from headaches and pressure on the head
for quite a long time, but the pain became exacerbated
some five years ago. The attack is sudden,
without any premonitory feelings, and lasts from
eight hours to two days. The headache often sets
in at night, when she is asleep, and she wakes up with
frightful pain.</p>

<p>At the time of the first attack she was much run
down. Otherwise the patient is in good condition,
but complains that her memory is getting bad. Patellar
reflex is exaggerated. Field of vision is normal.
The eyes show slight strabismus and astigmatism,
corrected by glasses which did not in the least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
diminish the intensity as well as the frequency of the
headaches.</p>

<p>Mrs. A. suffers from bad dreams and distressing
nightmares, the content of which she cannot recall in
her waking state. She also often has hallucinations,
visions of two women wrapped in white, pointing
their fingers at her and running after her. She
never had any fall, nor any special worry or anxiety,
never suffered from any infectious diseases.</p>

<p>After a persistent inquiry, however, she gave an
account of an accident she met with when a child
of eight. Opposite her house there lived an insane
woman of whom she was mortally afraid. Once when
the parents happened to be away, the insane woman
entered the house, caught the child, and greatly
frightened her. Another time she was sent out by
her parents to buy something in a grocery store. It
was night and very dark. She bought the things
and on the way back she saw two women in white
with hands stretched out running after her. She
screamed from great fright and ran home.</p>

<p>Mrs. A. is afraid to remain alone, and especially
in the dark. She is not so much afraid in the street
as in the house. The two women appear to her now
and then, and she is mortally afraid of them.</p>

<p>The patient was put into hypnotic state. There
was marked catalepsy; the eyes were firmly closed,
and she could not open them when challenged. Suggestion
of general well-being was given and she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
awakened. On awakening, she could not remember
what had taken place in the hypnotic state.</p>

<p>Next day she was again put into hypnosis and
went into a deeper state than the day before. She
was asked whether she thought of the crazy woman
occasionally, she replied in the negative. The patient
spoke in a low, suppressed voice, the words coming
out slowly, as if with effort and with fear. It
was then insisted that she should tell one of her
recent dreams. After some pause, she said: “Last
night I had a bad dream; I dreamt that I stood
near a window and a cat came up to the same window.
I saw it was crazy. I ran away, the cat ran after
me and scratched me. Then I knew that I was crazy.
My friends said there was no help for me.</p>

<p>“I dropped the baby, ran, and jumped down
stairs. I remember now that when I fell asleep I saw
a woman, maybe the crazy woman. I covered myself;
I knew I was only afraid, and that she was not
real. Six weeks ago I saw the same woman, when
falling asleep or when asleep. I ran away, and she
ran after me.”</p>

<p>Mrs. A. in relating these dreams, shivered all over
and was afraid, as if actually living the dream experience
over again. “It was this woman who
caught me in her arms, kissed me, and embraced me,
and did not let me go, until my screams brought
friends and my father; they took me away from her
by force.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>Gradually some more dreams emerged. “I dreamt
some time ago that the woman came to me and spilled
hot water on me. Another time I dreamed that I
was in the insane asylum; she came out, told me she
was well; I was greatly frightened and ran away.”</p>

<p>Mrs. A. then became quiet. After a while she
began to relate a series of dreams. Some time ago
she dreamed that the woman entered the room where
her father was and ran up to him, evidently with the
intention of hurting him. Her father ran away, and
she hid herself in a closet in the next room. “I also
dreamt that the woman was shadowing me in an
alley. She wanted to get hold of me, while I was
trying to get away from her. I turned round, and
she gave me such a fierce look. I ran and she could
not catch me. I should die, if she catches me. In
one of my dreams about her, I saw people putting
cold water on her, and I could hear her scream. It
was awful. I dreamt I went upstairs, opened the
door and met her. I was badly frightened. I
jumped out of the window.”</p>

<p>This is an extract from a letter sent to me by the
patient’s husband: “ ... She had another attack.
It did not last long, and it was not severe.
She dreamt several times a week. I shall try to relate
them as accurately as possible. She dreamt that
I left the room for a while. Our baby was asleep in
the next room. All of a sudden she heard baby cry
out: ‘Mamma, I am afraid.’ She told the baby to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
come to her as she herself was afraid to leave the
bed. Baby came to her. The child looked frightened,
her face pale with fear, exclaiming ‘Mamma, a devil.’
As the child cried out, my wife heard a noise in the
room, something moved close by. She became scared.
It seemed to her that something terrible and unknown
was after her. She wanted to scream for help,
but could not. A hand was stretched out after her
to catch her. She woke up in great terror. Another
time she dreamt that she was in a hall way. She
saw a woman and became frightened. It was the
same crazy woman. My wife is exceedingly nervous,
and is in fear that something awful is going to happen
to her or to the family.”</p>

<p>A rich, subconscious dream-life of agonizing fears
was thus revealed, a life of terrors of which the patient
was unaware in her waking state. The dreams
referred to the same central nucleus, the shock and
fears of her early childhood. Worries about self and
family kept up and intensified the present fear
states.</p>

<p>Her selfishness has no bounds, her fears have no
limits. The symptoms of the “fear set,” as in all
other psychopathic cases, took their origin in the
impulse of self-preservation with its accompanying
fundamental fear instinct.</p>

<p>This patient was cured after a long course of
hypnotic treatment.</p>

RECURRENT FEAR STATES,&mdash;PSYCHOLEPSY</h2>


<p>There are cases in which the nature of the psychopathic
states stands out more clearly and distinctly
than in others. They occur periodically, appearing
like epileptic states, in a sort of an explosive form,
so that some authorities have mistaken them for epilepsy,
and termed them psychic epilepsy. My researches
have shown them to be recurrent explosions
of subconscious states, which I termed <em>psycholepsy</em>.
They really do not differ from general psychopathic
states, but they may be regarded as classic <em>pseudo-epileptic</em>,
or <em>psycholeptic</em> states; they are classic
<em>fear-states</em>&mdash;<em>states of panic</em>.</p>

<p>M. L. is nineteen years of age, of a rather limited
intelligence. He works as a shopboy amidst surroundings
of poverty, and leads a hard life, full of
privations. He is undersized and underfed, and
looks as if he has never had enough to eat. Born in
New York, of parents belonging to the lowest social
stratum, he was treated with severity and even brutality.
The patient has never been to any elementary
school and can neither read nor write. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
mathematical knowledge did not extend beyond hundreds;
he can hardly accomplish a simple addition
and subtraction, and has no idea of the multiplication
table. The names of the President and a few
Tammany politicians constitute all his knowledge of
the history of the United States.</p>

<p>Family history is not known; his parents died
when the patient was very young, and he was left
without kith and kin, so that no data could be
obtained.</p>

<p>Physical examination is negative. Field of vision
is normal. There are no sensory disturbances. The
process of perception is normal, and so also is recognition.
Memory for past and present events is
good. His power of reasoning is quite limited, and
the whole of his mental life is undeveloped, embryonic.
His sleep is sound; dreams little. Digestion
is excellent; he can digest anything in the way of
eatables. He is of an easy-going, gay disposition,
a New York “street-Arab.”</p>

<p>The patient complains of “shaking spells.” The
attack sets in with tremor of all the extremities, and
then spreads to the whole body. The tremor becomes
general, and the patient is seized by a convulsion
of shivering, trembling, and chattering of teeth.
Sometimes he falls down, shivering, trembling, and
shaking all over, in an intense state of fear, a state
of panic. The seizure seems to be epileptiform, only
it lasts sometimes for more than three hours. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
attack may come any time during the day, but is
more frequent at night.</p>

<p>During the attack the patient does not lose consciousness;
he knows everything that is taking place
around him, can feel everything pretty well; his
teeth chatter violently, he trembles and shivers all
over, and is unable to do anything.</p>

<p>The fear instinct has complete possession of him.
He is in agony of terror. There is also a feeling of
chilliness, as if he is possessed by an attack of “fear
ague.” The seizure does not start with any numbness
of the extremities, nor is there any anaesthesia
or paraesthesia during the whole course of the attack.
With the exception of the shivers and chills
the patient claims he feels “all right.”</p>

<p>The patient was put into a condition close to the
hypnotic state. There was some catalepsy of a transient
character, but no suggestibility of the hypnotic
type. In this state it came to light that the patient
“many years ago” was forced to sleep in a dark,
damp cellar where it was bitter cold. The few nights
passed in that dark, cold cellar he had to leave his
bed, and shaking, trembling, and shivering with cold
and fear he had to go about his work in expectation
of a severe punishment in case of non-performance
of his duties.</p>

<p>While in the intermediary, subwaking, hypnoidal
state, the patient was told to think of that dark,
damp, cold cellar. Suddenly the attack set in,&mdash;the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
patient began to shake, shiver, and tremble all over,
his teeth chattering as if suffering from intense fear.
The attack was thus reproduced in the hypnoidal
state. “This is the way I have been,” he said. During
this attack no numbness, no sensory disturbance,
was present. The patient was quieted, and
after a little while the attack of shivering and fear
disappeared.</p>

<p>The room in which the patient was put into the
subconscious state was quite dark, and accidentally
the remark was dropped that the room was too dark
to see anything; immediately the attack reappeared
in all its violence. It was found later that it was sufficient
to mention the words, “dark, damp, and cold”
to bring on an attack even in the fully waking state.
We could thus reproduce the attacks at will,&mdash;those
magic words had the power to release the pent-up
subconscious forces and throw the patient into convulsions
of shakings and shiverings, with chattering
of the teeth and intense fear.</p>

<p>Thus the apparent epileptiform seizures, the
insistent psychomotor states of seemingly unaccountable
origin, were traced to subconscious fear
obsessions.</p>

<p>The following case is of similar nature. The study
clearly shows the subconscious nature of such psycholeptic
attacks:<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>
<p>Mr. M., aged twenty-one years, was born in Russia,
and came to this country four years previously.
His family history, as far as can be ascertained, is
good. There is no nervous trouble of any sort in
the immediate or remote members of his family.</p>

<p>The patient himself has always enjoyed good
health. He is a young man of good habits.</p>

<p>He was referred to me for epileptiform attacks
and anaesthesia of the right half of his body. The
attack is preceded by an aura consisting of headache
and a general feeling of malaise. The aura lasts a
few days and terminates in the attack which sets in
about midnight, <em>when the patient is fully awake</em>.
The attack consists of a series of spasms, rhythmic
in character, and lasting about one or two minutes.
After an interval of not more than thirty seconds
the spasms set in again.</p>

<p>This condition continues uninterruptedly for a
period of five or six days (a sort of status epilepticus),
persisting during the time the patient is awake,
and ceasing only during the short intervals, or
rather moments, of sleep. Throughout the whole
period of the attacks the patient is troubled with
insomnia. He sleeps restlessly for only ten or fifteen
minutes at a time. On one occasion he was observed
to be in a state of delirium as found in post-epileptic
insanity and the so-called Dämmerzustände of epilepsy.
This delirium was observed but once in the
course of five years.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>The regular attack is not accompanied by any
delirious states or Dämmerzustände. On the contrary,
during the whole course of the attack the
patient’s <em>mind remains perfectly clear</em>.</p>

<p>During the period of the attack the whole right
side becomes anaesthetic to all forms of sensations,
kinaesthesis included, so that he is not even aware of
the spasms unless he actually observes the affected
limbs.</p>

<p>The affected limbs, previously normal, also become
paretic. After the attack has subsided, the paresis
and anaesthesia persist (as sometimes happens in
true idiopathic epilepsy) for a few days, after which
the patient’s condition remains normal until the next
attack. After his last attack, however, the anaesthesia
and paresis continued for about three weeks.</p>

<p>He has had every year one attack which, curiously,
sets in about the same time, namely, about the month
of January or February. The attacks have of late
increased in frequency, so that the patient has had
four, at intervals of about three or four months. On
different occasions he was in the Boston City Hospital
for the attacks.</p>

<p>There was a profound right hemianaesthesia including
the right half of the tongue, with a marked
hypoaesthesia of the right side of the pharynx. All
the senses of the right side were involved. The field
of vision of the right eye was much limited. The
ticking of a watch could not be heard more than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
three inches away from the right ear. Taste and
smell were likewise involved on the right side. The
muscular and kinaesthetic sensations on the right
side were much impaired.</p>

<p>The patient’s mental condition was good. He
states that he has few dreams and these are insignificant,
concerned as they are with the ordinary
matters of daily life. Occasionally he dreams that
he is falling, but there is no definite content to the
dream.</p>

<p>These findings were indicative of functional rather
than organic disease. The <em>previous history</em> of the
case was significant. The first attack came on
after peculiar circumstances, when the patient was
sixteen years of age and living in Russia. After
returning from a ball one night, he was sent back
to look for a ring which the lady, whom he escorted,
had lost on the way. It was after midnight, and his
way lay on a lonely road which led by a cemetery.
When near the cemetery he was suddenly overcome
by a great fright, thinking that somebody was running
after him. He fell, <em>struck his right side</em>, and
lost consciousness. The patient did not remember
this last event. It was told by him when in a hypnotic
state.</p>

<p>The patient was a Polish Jew, densely ignorant,
terrorized by superstitious fears of evil powers working
in the dead of night.</p>

<p>By the time he was brought home he regained consciousness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
but there existed a spasmodic shaking of
the right side, involving the arm, leg, and head. The
spasm persisted for one week. During this time he
could not voluntarily move his right arm or leg, and
the right half of his body felt numb. There was
also apparently a loss of muscular sense, for he
stated that he was unaware of the shaking of his
arm or leg, unless he looked and saw the movements.
In other words, there was right hemiplegia, anaesthesia,
and spasms.</p>

<p>For one week after the cessation of the spasms
his right arm and leg remained weak, but he was soon
able to resume his work, and he felt as well as ever.
Since then every year, as already stated, about the
same month the patient has an attack similar in
every respect to the original attack, with the only
exception that there is no loss of consciousness.
Otherwise the subsequent yearly attacks are <em>photographic
pictures, close repetitions, recurrences of the
original attack</em>.</p>

<p>A series of experiments accordingly was undertaken.
First, as to the anaesthesia. If the anaesthesia
were functional, sensory impressions ought to
be felt, even though the patient was unconscious of
them, and we ought to be able to get sensory reactions.</p>

<p>Experiments made to determine the nature of the
anaesthesia produced interesting results. These experiments
show that the anaesthesia is not a true<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
one, but that impressions from the anaesthetic parts
which seem not to be felt are really perceived subconsciously.</p>

<p>Different tests showed that the subconscious reactions
to impressions from the anaesthetic hand
were more delicately plastic and responsive than the
conscious reactions to impressions from the normal
hand. We have the so-called “psychopathic paradox”
that <em>functional anaesthesia is a subconscious
hyperaesthesia</em>.</p>

<p>It is evident then that there could be no inhibition
of the sensory centres, or suppression of their activity,
or whatever else it may be called. In spite of the
apparent, profound anaesthesia, the pin pricks were
felt and perceived. Stimulations gave rise to
perception, cognition, to a sort of pseudo-hallucinations
that showed the pin pricks were counted and
localized in the hand. The results of these tests demonstrate
that in psychopathic patients all sensory
impressions received from anaesthetic parts, while
they do not reach the <em>personal</em> consciousness are perceived
<em>subconsciously</em>.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the sensations are perceived, the failure
of the subject to be conscious of them must be
due to a <em>failure in association</em>. The perception of
the sensation is dissociated from the personal consciousness.
More than this, these <em>dissociated</em> sensations
are capable of a certain amount of independent
functioning; hence the pseudo-hallucinations, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
hence the failure of psychopathic patients to be incommoded
by their anaesthesia. This condition of
dissociation underlies psychopathic states.</p>

<p>For the purpose of studying the attacks, the
patient was hypnotized. He went into a deep
somnambulic condition, in which, however, the <em>anaesthesia
still persisted</em>. This showed that the dissociation
of the sensory impressions was unchanged.</p>

<p>In hypnosis he related again the history of the
onset of the trouble. His memory became broader,
and he was able to give the additional information,
which he could not do in his waking state, that at the
time he was badly frightened, he fell on his right
side. Moreover, he recalled what he did not remember
when awake, that throughout the period of his
attacks when he fell asleep, he had vivid dreams of
an intense hallucinatory character, all relating to
terror and fall.</p>

<p>In these dreams he lived over and over again the
experience which was the beginning of his trouble.
He again finds himself in his little native town, on a
lonely road; he thinks some one is running after him;
he becomes frightened, calls for help, falls, and then
wakes up with a start, and the whole dream is forgotten.
After he wakes he knows nothing of all this;
there is no more fear or any emotional disturbance;
he is then simply distressed by the spasms.</p>

<p>While testing the anaesthesia during hypnosis, an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
attack developed, his right arm and leg began to
shake, first mildly and then with increasing intensity
and frequency. His head also spasmodically turned
to the right side. The movements soon became
rhythmic. Arm and leg were abducted and adducted
in a slow rhythmic way at the rate of about thirty-six
times per minute. With the same rate and
rhythm, the head turned to the right side, with chin
pointing upward. The right side of the face was
distorted by spasm, as if in great pain. The left
side of the face was unaffected. Pressure over his
right side (where he struck when he fell) elicited
evidences of great pain. Respiration became deep
and labored, and was synchronous with each spasm.
The whole symptom-complex simulated Jacksonian
epilepsy.</p>

<p>Consciousness persisted unimpaired, but showed
a curious and unexpected alteration. When asked
what was the matter, he replied in his native dialect,
“I do not understand what you say.” It was found
that he had lost all understanding of English, so
that it was necessary to speak to him in his native
dialect. His answers to our questions made it apparent
that during the attack, as in his dreams, he
was living through the experience which had originally
excited his trouble.</p>

<p>The attack was <em>hypnoidic, a fear attack</em>, hallucinatory
in character. He said that he was sixteen
years old, that he was in Rovno (Russia), that he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
had just fallen, because he was <em>frightened</em>, that he
was lying on the roadside near the cemetery, which
in the popular superstitious fear is inhabited by
ghosts. At that hour of the night the dead arise
from their graves and attack the living who happen
to be near.</p>

<p>The hypnoidic state developed further, the patient
living through, as in a dream, the whole experience
that had taken place at that period. He was in a
carriage, though he did not know who put him there.
Then in a few moments he was again home, in his
house, with his parents attending on him as in the
onset of his first epileptiform seizures.</p>

<p>The attack terminated at this point, and thereupon
he became perfectly passive, and when spoken
to answered again in English. Now he was again
twenty-one years old, was conscious of where he
was, and was in absolute ignorance of what had just
taken place.</p>

<p>It was found that an attack could regularly and
artificially be induced, if the patient in hypnosis was
taken back by suggestion to the period when the
accident happened.</p>

<p>The experiment was now tried of taking him back
to a period antedating the first attack. He was told
that he was fifteen years old, that is, a year before
the accident occurred. He could no longer speak or
understand English, he was again in Rovno, engaged
as a salesman in a little store, had never been in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
America, and did not know who we were. Testing
sensation, it was found that it had spontaneously returned
to the hand. <em>There was not a trace of the
anaesthesia left.</em> The hands which did not feel deep
pin pricks before now reacted to the slightest stimulation.
<em>Spontaneous synthesis of the dissociated
sensory impressions had occurred.</em> Just as formerly
before the accident, sensation was in normal association
with the rest of his mental processes, so now this
association was re-established with the memories of
that period to which the patient was artificially
reduced.</p>

<p>The patient was now (while still believing himself
to be fifteen years old) taken a year forward to the
day on which the accident occurred. He says he is
going to the ball tonight. He is now at the ball; he
returned home; he is sent back to look for a ring.
Like a magic formula, it calls forth an attack in
which again he lives through the accident,&mdash;the terror
and the spasms.</p>

<p>It was thus possible to reproduce an attack at any
time with clock-like precision by taking him back to
the period of the accident, and reproducing all its
details in a hypnoidic state. Each time the fear and
the physical manifestations of the attack (spasms,
paresis, and anaesthesia) developed. These induced
attacks were identical with the spontaneous attacks,
one of which we had occasion to observe later.</p>

<p>At periodic intervals, as under the stress of fear,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
the dormant activity is awakened and, though still
unknown to the patient, gives rise to the same sensori-motor
disturbances which characterized the
original experience. These subconscious dissociated
states are so much more intense in their manifestations
by the very fact of their dissociaton from the
inhibitory influences of the normal mental life.</p>

<p>The psychognosis of such cases reveals on the
one hand a dissociation of mental processes, and
on the other hand an independent and automatic
activity of subconscious psychic states, under the
disaggregating, paralyzing influence of the fear
instinct.</p>

<p>A patient under my treatment for four months
during the year of 1922 presents interesting traits.
I regard the case as classic as far as the fundamental
factors of neurosis are concerned.</p>

<p>Patient, male, age 32, married, has two children.
He lives in an atmosphere of fear and apprehension
about himself. He comes from a large, but healthy
family. The patient is of a rather cowardly disposition
especially in regard to his health. He worked
hard in a store during the day, and led a life of dissipation
at night. One day, after a night of unusual
dissipation, or orgy, when on his way to his work,
he felt weak, he was dizzy, he became frightened
about himself; he thought he had an attack of
apoplexy, and that he was going to die. His heart
was affected, it began to beat violently, and he trembled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
and shivered in an “ague” of intense fear. The
palpitation of the heart was so great, the trembling
was so violent, and the terror was so overwhelming
that he collapsed in a heap. He was taken to his
father’s store in a state of “fainting spell.” A physician
was called in who treated the patient for an
attack of acute indigestion.</p>

<p>For a short time he felt better, but the attacks
of terror, trembling, shivering, weakness, pallor,
fainting, palpitation of the heart and general collapse
kept on recurring. He then began to suffer
from insomnia, from fatigue, and is specially
obsessed by fear fatigue. He is in terror over the
fact that his energy is exhausted; physical, mental,
nervous, sexual impotence. This was largely developed
by physicians who treated him for epilepsy,
putting him on a bromide treatment; others treated
and diagnosed the case as cardiac affection, kidney
trouble, dementia praecox, and one physician operated
on the poor fellow for tonsillitis. The patient
was terrorized. He was on a diet for toxaemia, he
was starved. He took all sorts of medicine for his
insomnia.</p>

<p>The patient became a chronic invalid for ten years.
He was in terror, scared with the horrors of sleepless
nights. He has been to neurologists, to psychoanalysts,
and he tried Christian Science, New
Thought, Naturopathy, and Osteopathy, but of no
avail. The condition persisted. The attacks came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
on from time to time like thunder storms. There
were trembling, shivering, chattering of teeth, palpitation
of the heart, weakness, fainting, and overwhelming,
uncontrollable terror.</p>

<p>The first time I tried to put the patient into a
hypnoidal state was nine at night. I put out the
electric light, lighted a candle, and proceeded to put
him into a hypnoidal condition. The patient began
to shiver, to tremble, to breathe fast and heavily, the
pulse rose to over 125, while the heart began to
thump violently, as if it were going to jump out.
He was like one paralyzed, the muscles of the chest
labored hard, and under my pressure the muscle
fibers hardened, crackled, became rigid, and he could
not reply when spoken to. It took me some time to
quieten him. He was clearly in a state of great
panic. I opened his eyelids and found the eye ball
turned up. The whole body was easily put in a
state of catalepsy. Clearly the patient was not in
a hypnoidal state, he was in a state of hypnosis.
Night after night he fell into states of hypnosis
with all the symptoms of intense fear attacks. When
the fear attacks subsided the depths of the hypnotic
state proportionately diminished.</p>

<p>In my various clinical and laboratory experimental
work, covering a period of a quarter of a century,
I have gradually come to the conclusion that
fear and hypnosis are interrelated. In fact I am disposed
to think that the hypnotic state is an ancient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
state, a state of fear cataplexy, or rather trance
obedience. While the hypnoidal state is a primitive
sleep state, the hypnotic condition is a primitive,
fear condition, still present in lowly formed organisms.</p>

<p>After some time the general fear instinct becomes
alleviated. The patient goes by habit into a trance
hypnotic state under the influence of the hypnotizer
in whom he gains more confidence. The patient
gets into a state of trance obedience to the hypnotizer
of whom he is in awe, and who can control the
patient’s fear instinct.</p>

<p>Man obeys the commands, “the suggestions” of
the hypnotizer, of the master whom he subconsciously
fears, and who inspires him with awe, with
“confidence-fear”. The crowd, the community, “public
opinion,” the mob, the leader, the priest, the
magician, the medicine man, are just such forces,
such authorities to procure the slavish obedience of
the subconscious described as hypnosis. Soldiers
and slaves fall most easily into such states.</p>

<p>Man has been trained in fear for milleniums, in
fear of society, custom, fashion, belief, and the authority
of crowd and mob. He fears to stand alone,
he must go with the crowd.</p>

<p>Man is a social being, a hypnotized, somnambulic
creature. He walks and acts like a hypnotized
slave. Man is a social somnambulist who believes,
dreams, and acts at the order of the mob or of its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
leader. Man belongs to those somnambulists who
become artificial, suggested, automatic personalities
with their eyes fully open, seeing and observing
nothing but what is suggested to them.</p>

<p>The hypnoidic states, observed and described by
me in the classical Hanna case, belong to the same
category. The hypnoidic states are essentially fear
cataleptic states of a vivid character, closely related
to hypnotic conditions of primitive life.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<br />
APHONIA, STAMMERING, AND CATALEPSY</h2>


<p>S. R. Age 25. Russian Jewess; married; has four
children. Patient was brought to me in a state of
helplessness. She could not walk, and was unable
to utter a word. When spoken to she replied in gestures.
When challenged to walk, she made unsuccessful
attempts. The step was awkward, the gait
reeling, the body finally collapsing in a heap on the
floor. When I shut her eyelids, the eyeballs began
to roll upwards, the lids soon became cataleptic, and
the patient was unable to open them. When I insisted
that she should open the lids, she strained
hard,&mdash;the muscles of the upper part of the body
became painfully tense,&mdash;wrinkled her forehead, and
contorted violently her face. After long insistence
on her replying to my questions, and after long vain
efforts to comply with my request, she at last succeeded
in replying in a barely audible voice. When
whispering she kept on making incoordinate movements
with jaws and lips, began to shut her eyelids,
rolled up the eye-balls, forced the tongue against the
teeth, stammered badly on consonants, uttering them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
with great difficulty after long hesitation, the sound
finally coming out with explosive force.</p>

<p>I insisted that she must stand up, she raised herself
slowly and with effort, took a couple of steps,
and sat down at once on the chair. During the
period of effort there was marked tremor in her left
arm. When she sat down, she threw her head backward,
rolled up her eyeballs, and began gradually to
close her eyelids. She remained in this position for a
couple of minutes, and then began spasmodically to
open and shut the eyelids. When taken to her room,
the patient walked up, though with some difficulty,
three flights of stairs without the nurse’s support.</p>

<p>The patient was greatly emaciated,&mdash;she lived in
extreme poverty. She was married five years, and
had given birth to four children. Patient was suffering
from severe headaches which set in soon after
the birth of the second child. At first the headaches
came at intervals of a few weeks, and lasted about a
day, then with the birth of the other children the
headaches grew more severe and more frequent, and
finally became continuous. From time to time the
attacks were specially exacerbated in violence, she
then complained of violent pains in the head, excruciating
agony toward the vertex. The face was
deadly pale, the hands and feet were ice-cold, the
pulse weak and sluggish. During the attack the
head had to be raised, since in any other position the
pain was unbearable. The pain was originally unilateral,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
starting on the left side of the head. Of
late the pain spread from left to right. The whole
head felt sore, like a boil, the scalp was highly sensitive.
The intense attacks, sweeping over the
patient unawares, were accompanied by twitchings
of the eyelids, rolling of the eyeballs, dizziness, sparks
before the eyes, pains in the left side of the chest,
and by numbness and hypoaesthesia of the face, arms
and legs. The patellar reflex was markedly exaggerated,
no clonus was present; the pupils reacted
well to light and accommodation.</p>

<p>The patient was admitted to a local hospital, and
was allowed to nurse her one year old baby. Three
days after admission, while nursing her baby, she
was seized with a violent attack of headache and
pain in the left side. The arms felt numb and
“gone.” The patient was seized with a panic that
the child might fall; hugging the baby to her left
breast she screamed for help in agony and terror.
Immediately following this seizure the patient lost
her voice, speech, and power of walking.</p>

<p>After staying in the hospital for two weeks, the
patient was put under my care.</p>

<p>The patient was an extremely timid creature. She
lived in Russia in a small town where the religious
persecutions of the neighbors were persistent and
unremittent. To this were joined the petty annoyances
by the village police, the representatives of
which acted with all the cruel tyranny characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
of the old Russian regime. The patient’s family was
in constant terror. In childhood the patient has
undergone all the horrors of the <em>pogromi</em> with all the
terrors of inquisitorial tortures. A highly sensitized
impulse of self-preservation and intense easily
stimulated fear instinct were the essence of the patient’s
life. She was afraid of everything, of her
very shadow, of anything strange, more so in the
dark, and at night. With this morbid self-preservation
and intensified fear instinct there were associated
superstitions to which her mind was exposed
in early childhood, and in her later life. The patient
lived at home in the fear of the most savage
superstitions and prejudices, characteristic of the
poor ignorant classes of Eastern European countries,
and outside the house she was in fear of her
life. The patient was brought up on fear and nourished
on fear. No wonder when she was run down,
and met with a fear shock, that the fear instinct
seized on her and gave rise to the symptoms of
physical and mental paralysis.</p>

<p>To this life of terror we may add the extreme
poverty in which the patient lived in Russia and
afterwards in this country. The hard work in a
sweat-shop and the ill nutrition ran down the patient
and further predisposed her to disability and disease.
Patient lived in constant dread of actual starvation,
with fear of having no shelter, with fear of
no roof over her head. She was so timid that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
was scared by any sudden movement, or by a severe,
harsh, threatening voice. She was extreme suggestible,
imitative, and credulous. She was like a
haunted animal, like a scared bird in the claws of
a cat. Fear often threw her into a state of rigidity.</p>

<p>The patient suffered from a fear of fatigue, from
fear of exhaustion, from fear of disability, from
fear of paralysis, pain, sickness, and death, fear
of the negative aspect of the most primitive, and
most fundamental of all impulses, the impulse of
self-preservation. The fear psychosis, based on an
abnormally developed fear instinct which formed the
main structure of her symptom complex, had a real
foundation in the psycho-physiological condition of
her organism. The patient actually suffered from
fatigue due to exhaustion, underfeeding, and overworking.</p>

<p>Married at the age of twenty, she bore four children
in succession. This was a drain on the poor
woman, and further weakened her feeble constitution.
Her husband was a poor tailor working in
a sweat-shop, making but a few dollars a week. The
family was practically kept in a state of chronic
starvation. The wolf was hardly kept away from
the door. The family was in constant dread of
“slack time” with its loss of employment and consequent
privations and suffering.</p>

<p>The husband was a hard worker, did not drink,
but the long hours of work, the low wages, the poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
nutrition, the vicious air, and the no less vicious environment,
cheerless and monotonous, sometimes
gave rise to moods, discontent, anger, and quarrels,
of which the patient with her timidity stood in
utter terror.</p>

<p>The patient’s dream life was strongly colored by
a general underlying mood of apprehension. The fear
instinct of self-preservation formed the soil of the
whole emotional tone of the psychosis, waking, sub-waking,
dreaming, conscious, and subconscious.
Again and again did the nurses and attendants report
to me that, although the patient was aphonic
and it was hard to elicit from her a sound, in her
sleep she quite often cried out, sometimes using
phrases and words which were hard to comprehend,
because they were indistinct, and because they were
sometimes in her native language. When awakened
immediately, it was sometimes possible to elicit from
her shreds of dreams in regard to scares and frights
about herself, about her children, about her husband,
relatives, and friends. When she came under my
care the patient often used to wake up in the morning
in a state of depression due to some horrible
hallucinatory dreams in which she lived over again
in a distorted form, due to incoordination of content
and to lack of active, guiding attention, dreams
in which the dreadful experience of her miserable
life kept on recurring under various forms of fragmentary
association and vague synthesis, brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
about by accidental, external and internal stimulations.</p>

<p>The patient was taken to her room in the evening,
and put to bed. During the night she was somewhat
restless, kept on waking up, but on the whole,
according to the nurse’s account, she slept quite
well. In the morning the patient had a hearty
breakfast, and felt better than the day before when
she was brought to me. The voice improved somewhat
in strength and volume. During the day she
rested, felt well, and enjoyed her meals. Speech
was still in a whisper barely audible, but there was
no stammering, no muscular incoordination, no
twitchings of the face. About four in the afternoon
patient sat up in bed, her voice became somewhat
stronger, though speech was still in a whisper.
This improvement lasted but a few minutes.
When her arms were raised, the left hand manifested
considerable tremor and weakness as compared
with the right arm. After having made a few
remarks which apparently cost her considerable effort,
she had a relapse, she again lost her voice,
and was unable to whisper. I insisted that she
should reply to my questions; she had to make a
great effort, straining her muscles and bringing
them into a state of convulsive incoordination before
she could bring out a few sounds in reply.
A little later, about ten or fifteen minutes after
I left the room, the nurse came in and quietly asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
her a question, the patient answered in a whisper,
with little strain and difficulty. An hour later
the patient regained her speech for a short period
of a few minutes. These changes went on during
the patient’s waking period. Once towards evening
the patient regained her voice and speech to
such an extent that she could talk with no difficulty
and little impediment; the voice was so
resonant and strong that it could be heard in the
hall adjoining the room. This however lasted but
a few moments.</p>

<p>After having had a good night’s sleep the patient
woke up in good condition; appetite was good.
Voice was clear, though low. She was in a state of
lassitude and relaxation. I attempted to examine
her and kept testing her condition, physical and
mental. I was anxious to make a psychognosis of
the patient’s case. The tests and the questions
strained her nervous system by requiring to hold
her attention, and by keeping her in a state of
nervous and mental agitation. She looked scared,
anxious,&mdash;the scared, haunted look in her face reappeared.
The patient was no more than about
twenty to twenty-five minutes under experimentation
when a severe headache of the vertex and of
the left side of the head set in. The eyeballs began
to roll up, eyelids were half closed; lids and eyeballs
were quivering and twitching. The hands were relaxed
and looked paralyzed. When raised they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
fell down by her side in an almost lifeless condition.
There was marked hypoaesthesia to pain and
heat sensations. The anaesthesia was more marked
on the left than on the right side. The left arm
when raised and kept for a few seconds showed
marked tremor as compared with the right arm.
This is to be explained by the fact that the exacerbations
of the headache, of pain, and the general
cataleptic seizures set in usually during or
after the nursing periods. The infant while nursing
was kept by the mother on the left arm, the left
side thus bearing the pressure, weight, and strain,&mdash;it
was with the left side that fear became mainly
associated.</p>

<p>During the height of the attack the patient was
quietened, her fears allayed, and a five-grain tablet
of phenacetine was given her with the authoritative
remark that the drug was sure to help her. As
soon as she swallowed the tablet the patient opened
her eyes, and said she felt better. About an hour
later, when another attempt at an examination was
made, patient had an attack of headache, cried, said
she was afraid, but she answered in a whisper when
spoken to. She talked slowly, in a sort of staccato
way. I insisted that she should talk a little faster
and pronounce the words distinctly. She made violent
attempts to carry out my command, but got
scared, began to hesitate, and stammer, her voice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
and speech rapidly deteriorating with her efforts,
ending in complete mutism.</p>

<p>During the day I tried from time to time to
keep up the experiment of insisting that the patient
should speak, and every time with the same result
of bringing about an attack.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The patient began
to stammer and stutter, becoming more and more
frightened the more the nurse and myself insisted
that she should make an effort and reply to our
questions. Still, when the patient’s attention became
distracted, when she was handled gently, when
her fears were allayed, the speech and sound improved
in quality and in loudness, and at times her
sentences were quite fluent, her enunciation quite
distinct.</p>

<p>This state of instability lasted for several days
until the patient became somewhat familiar with
the surroundings. In one of her better moments
the patient told me that she thought her stammering
began with a definite event. One evening when
she was fatigued with the labors of the day for
her family, a stammerer came in to see her. The
stammering made a strong impression on her. She
felt the strain of the stammerer; she could not control
the sympathy and the strain, and involuntarily
began to imitate stammering. She began to
fear that she might continue to stammer and be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
unable to enunciate sounds and words. The more
she feared the harder it was for her to speak or
even to use her voice.</p>

<p>A few days later the patient began to improve,
she began to adapt herself to her surroundings, and
did not get so easily scared.</p>

<p>About eight days after the first examination the
patient woke up one morning in a state of depression;
she cried a good deal. She did not sleep well
the night before, dreamt and worried on account of
her children. She was afraid that something might
have happened to them in her absence, perhaps they
were sick, perhaps the husband could not take good
care of them. She talked in a whisper, her eyes were
shut. When I insisted on opening the eyelids, she
opened them, but did it with difficulty. I put her
into a hypnotic state. In about a minute her eyes
rolled up, and the eyelids shut spasmodically. There
was present a slight degree of catalepsy. Mutism
was strongly marked. Upon sudden and unexpected
application of an electric current, the patient
opened her eyes, cried out, but soon relapsed into
a state of lethargy. Gradually patient was brought
out of the lethargic state.</p>

<p>A couple of hours later, after she had a good
rest a few more experiments as to her sensori-motor
life were attempted. I asked her to raise objects,
tested her sensitivity to various stimulations, her
concentration of attention, asked her questions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
about her life, about her family, took again her field
of vision. All that was a great effort to her. While
I was taking her field of vision the patient’s eyes
began to close, and it took about twenty seconds
before she could open them. She opened them with
effort, but shut them again. This time it took her
about 45 seconds before she could open the lids.
Fatigue, or rather fear fatigue, set in sooner with
each repetition of experiment and test, and lasted
a longer time.</p>

<p>For several days the patient kept on improving
slowly. She then had another relapse. She slept
well the night before, but woke up early about six
in the morning; she began to worry about her family,
and complained of headache. About half past
eight the headache became severe, there was again
pain in the left side, the left hand began to tremble,
and felt anaesthetic, the eyelids closed, and could not
open, aphonia returned, in fact she fell into a state
of mutism. About ten o’clock patient opened her
eyes, but she was unable to talk. After long insistence
on her reply to my question as to how she
was, she finally replied in a whisper: “Well,” then
added “I have a bad headache.” She had great
difficulty in replying to my questions, moved her
jaws impotently before she was able to emit a sound,
her muscles were strained, the face was set, tense,
and drawn, the brow was corrugated, the eyeballs
rolled up, and the eyelids shut tightly. The patient<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
was unable to raise her hands, they lay powerless
at her side. When raised the arms were found
to be lethargic, fell to her side, only the left hand
manifested light, fibrillary twitchings and a gross
tremor. When insisted upon that she must raise
her arms, she became agitated, scared, began to
moan and cry. Claimed severe pain in head, in chest,
in heart. “Pain in heart, in head, I am afraid,”
she moaned in a whisper. There was loss of kinaesthetic
sensibility, patient complained that she
did not feel her arms, “they are not mine.” She
had to look at the arm in order to find it. There
was also present anaesthsia to other sensations such
as pain, touch, heat, and cold. After a couple of
hours’ rest the sensibility returned. The sensibility
was affected more on the left side than on the right,
and also returned earlier on the right side.</p>

<p>When the fatigue and the scare subsided the patient
was tested again. This time the reactions to
sensory stimulations were normal. The patient was
touched, pinched, and pricked, she reacted to each
stimulus separately, and was able to synthesize them
and give a full account of their number. Kinaesthetic
sensibility was good,&mdash;she was fully able to
appreciate the various movements and positions in
which her limbs and fingers were put.</p>

<p>The patient was left to rest, quietened, treated
carefully, avoiding sudden stimulations, allaying her
fears and suspiciousness of danger, lurking in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
background of her mind. After a few hours she
sat up, made an attempt to raise herself from bed,
got up with some effort, and sat down in an easy
rocking chair next to her. Her eyes were wide
open. Asked how she was, she replied in a whisper
that she felt quite well. The effort however
fatigued her, her head began to drop, eyelids began
to close, and the eyeballs began to roll up.
Twitchings were observed in the eyelids, and tremors
in the left arm. She was again put to bed and
given a rest of a few hours. She opened her eyes,
and told me that she was weak. This statement she
herself volunteered. I found that she could move
her hands easily, and that the numbness was completely
gone.</p>

<p>For a whole week the patient kept on growing
in health and in strength, her sensori-motor reactions
improved, she walked round the room for
a few minutes, talked in a low voice for a quarter
of an hour at a time without manifesting her symptoms
of fatigue; her appetite and sleep improved
accordingly. At the end of the week there was again
a relapse,&mdash;she did not sleep well the night before,
dreamt of being hunted and tortured, woke up depressed,
had no appetite for breakfast, complained
of headache, pains, worries, and fears. The headaches
have abated in their virulence during last week,
but now they seemed to have reappeared in their
former vigor. When I began to examine her she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
looked frightened, her eyeballs rolled up, her eyelids
closed. The aphonia was severe, patient lost
speech and voice. When spoken to she could not
answer. Asked if she heard me, she nodded her head
affirmatively. There were slight twitchings of her
left hand and also of the muscles of her face. When
attention was attracted to the arm the twitchings
increased in violence and rapidity. With the distraction
of the attention the twitchings disappeared.
When the left hand was put in the patient’s field
of vision, thus making her attention concentrate on
that limb, the tremors increased again, becoming
finally convulsive in character.</p>

<p>I insisted she should try to open her mouth, and
say something,&mdash;she made fruitless efforts, moving
incoordinately the muscles of the face and of the
forehead, but she could not utter a sound. She
could not move her arms on command, could hardly
wriggle the fingers of her hand. She appeared like
a little bird paralyzed by fear. When the arm was
raised passively it fell down slowly being in a cataleptic
state.</p>

<p>I allayed the patient’s fear. I strongly impressed
her with the groundlessness of her fears, and also
with the fact that everything was well with the children,
and that her husband will be good and gentle
with her. The patient was permitted to see her
family. The husband was made to realize that
he must treat her with more consideration. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
came often to visit her, and learned to treat her
well. He soon found a better position, was advised
to remove to a healthy locality and to more cheerful
surroundings. The children were well cared
for. The patient found deep satisfaction in the
midst of this family happiness. The fear state
abated,&mdash;the patient became more confident, more
hopeful for the future, and began to improve. The
infant was weaned so that the strain of nursing
was removed. The patient’s appetite began to improve;
she gained several pounds in a few days.
Long periods of examination and investigation of
her nervous and mental state no longer exhausted
or terrified her. Her concentration of attention
could be kept up from a quarter to half an hour
at a stretch without giving rise to fatigue, headache,
or to a seizure with its consequent psychomotor
effects. The haunted look of fear disappeared,
and along with it were also gone the fatigue and
dread of physical and mental exercise or work.
She could work and walk with ease the whole length
of the room and of the hall. She began to take
more and more interest in her appearance and in
dress. For many minutes at a time she looked out
on the street taking an interest in all that was done
and what was going on.</p>

<p>The case was discharged, and was sent home.
She continued to stay well.</p>

<br />
SUGGESTED HALLUCINATIONS</h2>


<p>The servility, the state of fear of the subconscious,
the source of neurosis, in its relation to the master
hypnotizer is well brought out in the mechanism of
hypnotic and post-hypnotic hallucinations.</p>

<p>Before we proceed with our discussion it may
be well to give an analysis, however brief, of the normal
percept, of the abnormal percept or hallucination,
and then compare them with hypnotic and post-hypnotic
hallucinations. The understanding of
perception, normal and abnormal, is, in fact, at the
basis of normal and abnormal psychology.</p>

<p>We may begin with the percept and its elements.
In looking at the vase before me I see its beautiful
tints, its rounded shape, its heavy pedestal
with its rough curves, its solidity, weight, brittleness,
and other experiences which go to make up the
perception of the vase. The visual elements are
given directly by the visual perceptive experience;
but whence come the seemingly direct experiences
of weight, heaviness, roughness, smoothness, and
others of the like kind? They are evidently derived<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
from other senses. The whole perceptive experience
is of a visual character. We take in the
whole with our eye. In the organic structure of
the percept then, besides the experiences directly
given by the stimulated sense-organ, there are other
experiences, sensory in character, indirectly given,
and coming from other sense organs which are not
directly stimulated.</p>

<p>The percept is a complicated dynamic product,
and its elementary processes are never derived from
one isolated domain of sensory experience. The activities
of all the sensory domains co-operate in
the total result of an apparently simple percept.
Along with sensory processes directly stimulated,
a mass of other sensory processes becomes organized
and helps to contribute to the total result. The
direct sensory elements are termed by me <em>primary
sensory elements</em>; the indirectly given experiences
are termed <em>secondary sensory elements</em>. The secondary
sensory elements may be figuratively said to
cluster round the primary sensory elements as their
nucleus.</p>

<p>The whole perceptual experience is tinged by the
character of the primary elements which constitute
the guiding nucleus, so to say. Thus, where the
primary sensory elements are visual, the whole mass,
no matter from what domain the sensory experiences
are derived, appears under the form of the visual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
sense, and the percept is a visual percept. While
the primary sensory elements form, so to say, the
dynamic center of the total perceptual experience,
the secondary sensory elements mainly constitute its
content. Both primary and secondary elements are
sensory and are induced peripherally; the primary
directly, the secondary indirectly. The percept
then is sensory and is constituted by primary sensory
elements, or primary sensations, and by secondary
sensory elements, or secondary sensations.</p>

<p>The character of the secondary sensory elements
stands out clear and independent in the phenomena
of synaesthesia, of secondary sensations. In the
phenomena of synaesthesia we have a sensation of
one sense organ followed, without an intermediary
direct stimulation, by a sensation coming from another
sense organ. Thus, when a sensation of light
instead of giving rise to a subsequent idea gives rise
to a sensation of sound, for instance, we have the
phenomenon of secondary sensation. Here the secondary
sensations stand out free and distinct, but
they are really always present in our ordinary perceptive
experiences as bound up secondary sensory
elements, as secondary sensations grouped round
primary sensations.</p>

<p>When the phenomena of synaesthesia were first
brought to the notice of the scientific world, they
were regarded as abnormal and exceptional, and only
present in special pathological cases. Soon, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
their field became widened, and they were found
not only in the insane and degenerate, but in many
persons otherwise perfectly normal. We find now
that we must further widen the field of secondary
sensory elements, and instead of regarding them as
a freak of nature existing under highly artificial conditions,
we must put them at the very foundation of
the process of perception.</p>

<p>Secondary sensations are at the basis of perception.
We have become so accustomed to them
that we simply disregard them. When, however, the
conditions change, when the secondary sensations
stand out by themselves, isolated from the primary
nuclear elements with which they are usually organically
synthesized into a whole, into a percept,
when they become dissociated, it is only then that
we become conscious of them directly and declare
them as abnormal.</p>

<p>Secondary sensations are always present in every
act of perception; in fact, they form the main content
of our perceptual activity, only we are not
conscious of them, and it requires a special analysis
to reveal them. Secondary sensations <em>per se</em> are
not something abnormal&mdash;just as hydrogen present
in the water we drink or the oxygen present in
the air we breathe are not newly created elements,&mdash;it
only requires an analysis to discover them. If
there be any abnormality about secondary sensations,
it is not in the elements themselves, but rather<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
in the fact of their dissociation from the primary
nuclear elements.</p>

<p>When the secondary sensory elements come to
the foreground and stand out clearly in consciousness,
a full-fledged hallucination arises. In the
phenomena of synaesthesia we have hallucinations
in the simplest form, inasmuch as only isolated secondary
sensory elements dissociated from their active
primary central elements stand out in the foreground
of consciousness. This very simplification,
however, of hallucinations reveals their inner character.
The most complex hallucinations are only
complex compounds, so to say, of secondary sensory
elements. Hallucinations are not anything mysterious,
different from what we find in the normal
ordinary processes of perception; they are of the
same character and have the same elements in their
constitution as those of perception. Both hallucinations
and percepts have the same secondary as well
as primary elements. The difference between hallucinations
and percepts is only one of relationship,
of rearrangement of elements, primary and secondary.
When <em>secondary sensory elements become under
conditions of dissociation dynamically active in
the focus of consciousness we have hallucinations</em>.</p>

<p>From this standpoint we can well understand why
a hallucination, like a percept, has all the attributes
of external reality. A hallucination is not any
more mysterious and wonderful than a percept is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
We do not recognize the humdrum percept, when
it appears in the guise of a hallucination, and we
regard it as some strange visitant coming from a
central, or from some supersensory universe. Hallucinations,
like percepts, are constituted of primary
and especially of secondary sensory elements,
and like percepts, hallucinations too are induced
peripherally.</p>

<p>How is it with suggested<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> or hypnotic hallucinations?
Do we find in hypnotic or suggested hallucinations,
as in the case of hallucinations in general,
the requisite primary and secondary sensory
elements directly and indirectly induced? Binet
makes an attempt to establish a peripheral stimulus
in the case of hypnotic hallucinations, claiming that
there is a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">point de repére</i>, a kind of a peg, on which
the hypnotic hallucination is hung. It is questionable
whether Binet himself continued to maintain
this position. However the case may be, this position
is hardly tenable when confronted with facts.
Hypnotic hallucinations may develop without any
peg and prop.</p>

<p>Furthermore, granted even that now and then
such a peg could be discovered, and that the alleged
hypnotic hallucination develops more easily when
such a peg is furnished, still the fact remains that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
even in such cases the peg is altogether insignificant,
that it is altogether out of proportion and relation
to the suggested hallucination, and that on the same
peg all kinds of hallucinations can be hung, and
that finally it can be fully dispensed with. All this
would go to show that the peg, as such, is of no
consequence, and is really more of the nature of an
emphatic suggestion for the development of the alleged
hypnotic or post-hypnotic hallucinations.</p>

<p>The arbitrariness of the hypnotic hallucinations,
showing that the whole thing is simply a matter
of representations, or of what the patient happens
to think at that particular moment, is well brought
out in the following experiments: Mr. F. is put
into a hypnotic state, and a post-hypnotic suggestion
is given to him that he shall see a watch. The
eyeball is then displaced, the watch is also displaced;
now when the eyeball returns to its normal condition
we should expect that the hallucinatory watch
would return to its former place; but no, the watch
is not perceived in its previous place,&mdash;it appears
in a displaced position. The hallucinatory watch
could thus be displaced any distance from its original
position. The patient evidently did not see
anything, but simply supplied from his stock of
knowledge as to how a seen watch would appear
under such conditions, and he omitted to observe
the fact that with the normal position of the eye
the watch should once more return to its former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
position. Such inconsistencies are often found in
hypnosis.</p>

<p>More intelligent and better informed patients
would reason out the matter differently, and would
give different results. If the subject knows of contrast
colors and if a color is suggested to him he
will without fail see such contrast colors. If his
eyes have been fixed on some hallucinatory color,
such as red, for instance, he will even give you a
detailed account of the green he sees, but if he does
not know anything of the effects of contrast colors
no amount of fixation on hallucinatory colors will
bring out the least contrast effects. The reason
is the patient does not know anything about it
and cannot think of it.</p>

<p>We tried to mix by suggestion different hallucinatory
colors, and as long as he knew nothing of the
real results his replies were uniformly wrong; no
sooner did he find out what the right mixture <em>should</em>
be than he gave correct results. The hypnotic subject
really does not perceive anything; he tells what
he believes the master wants him to see under the
given conditions. The subconscious fear instinct
makes the hypnotized subject obey and please the
hypnotizer, as the dog obeys his master.</p>

TRANCE SERVILITY</h2>


<p>Dr. C., a known psychoanalyst, on whom I carried
on a series of experiments, goes into a deep
somnambulistic state. He is an excellent visualizer
and takes readily visual hallucinations. Being a
physician and psychiatrist the subject’s account is
all the more valuable. Now Dr. C. describes his hypnotic
hallucinations as “mental pictures,” as “auditory
memories,” which “lack exteriority, are not
located in space.” He aptly characterizes his hallucinations,
visual, auditory, and others, as “<em>fixed
ideas</em>.”</p>

<p>Mr. M. goes into deep hypnosis. When in one
of the deep trance-states a suggestion is given to
him that on awakening he shall see a watch. When
awake he claims he sees a watch. He was asked:
“Do you really see it?” He replied, “Yes.” The
interesting point here was the fact that the subject
did not even look in the direction where the suggested
hallucinatory watch was supposed to be
placed and where he himself claimed that the watch
was located. When tested by automatic writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
the hand wrote: “Yes, I see the watch.” The subconscious
then was also under the influence of the
suggested hallucination. It is well to bear in mind
this point.</p>

<p>Re-hypnotized, and suggested that on awakening
he would see <em>two</em> watches. One was a real silver
watch and the other was suggested hallucinatory.
The subject claimed he saw both, but he only
handled the hallucinatory one, and when asked which
of the two he would prefer he pointed to the hallucinatory
watch. When asked why, he replied that
the suggested watch was bigger. He was really indifferent
to the chosen watch and paid no further
attention to it, as if it did not exist for him. He
tried to please the master hypnotizer of whom he
was subconsciously in awe.</p>

<p>He was again put into the hypnotic state and
was suggested to see a flower. On awakening he
claimed he saw a flower and smelled it in an indifferent,
perfunctory fashion. The subconscious was
then tested by automatic writing and the writing
was to the effect that he saw it. “I see a flower.”
The subconscious then had also the same hallucination.
A series of similar experiments was carried
out with the same results. <em>The subconscious claimed
in automatic writing that the suggested hallucination
was real.</em></p>

<p>The subject was again put into hypnosis and
was given the suggestion that he would see a watch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
on awakening, but here I made some modification.
“When you wake up you will be sure to see a watch,”
I said, emphatically. “Look here; I want you to
write what you really see and not what you do not
see.” When awake he saw a watch, but he immediately
wrote: “I do not see anything.” <em>Here the
subconscious disclaimed the suggested hallucinations
which it had claimed and insisted on before.</em></p>

<p>Re-hypnotized, and was given the suggestion that
on awakening he would see three watches. He was
awakened and a real silver watch was put before
him; the other two were suggested hallucinatory.
He claimed he saw all three. Meanwhile, in automatic
writing he wrote: “One silver watch, real,
the others golden, not real; nothing there.” A
series of similar experiments was made and with
the same results. <em>The automatic writing disclaimed
the hallucinations, although before, under the same
conditions, it most emphatically insisted on their
reality.</em></p>

<p>The subject was put into hypnosis and a post-hypnotic
suggestion was given to him that he would
see his wife and child. When awake, he began to
smile. When asked why he smiled he said: “I
see my wife and child”; but he wrote “I see nobody.”
When put again in hypnosis he still continued to
smile and said: “I see my wife and child”; but
he wrote (in hypnotic state): “I really do not see
them; I see nothing; I see my child, but I really<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
see nothing.” That was when the psychopathic patient
got the inkling that I wished to know the
truth rather than to be misled by his slavish
obedience and fears by complying with my orders.
“What do you mean,” I asked, “by ‘I see my child,
but I really see nothing?’” To which he replied
in automatic writing: “I mean that I see my child
in my mind only, but I don’t see anything.”</p>

<p>I then gave him a post-hypnotic suggestion to
see a snake. He claimed on awaking that he saw
a snake. He manifested little fear. He certainly
did not behave as if he really saw a snake and
instead wrote “I see a snake. I see it in my mind.”
A great number of similar experiments were carried
out by me, varying the suggestions, and all
with the same results. I shall not burden the reader
with a detailed account, as they all gave identical
results.</p>

<p>At first the automatic writing claimed emphatically
the presence of the hallucinatory object
and when the truth of the automatic writing was
insisted on, the writing disclaimed fully the perception
of the hallucinatory object. Finally we
came on the real character of the suggested hallucination;
“I see my child, but <em>honestly</em>, I do not
see anything; I see my child in my mind only, I
don’t see anything.” In other words, if we take
the facts plainly and do not play hide and seek
with the subconscious, we come to the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
that in the suggested hallucinations the subject does
not perceive anything as is the case in an actual
hallucination. He does not <em>perceive</em>, but he simply
<em>thinks</em> of the suggested hallucination.</p>

<p>As long then as the automatic writing was regarded
by the subject as independent, for which
he was not responsible, as long as the suggestion of
the hallucination was not taken as directly addressed
to it, the subject himself frankly acknowledged
the fact that he did not see anything. When this
truth of automatic writing was brought home to
the subject he was bound by suggestion to claim
that he actually saw the suggested hallucination,
although he really did not see anything at all.</p>

<p>This clearly shows that the hypnotic consciousness,
from the very nature of its heightened suggestibility,
clings most anxiously to the given suggestion,
and insists on the reality of its fulfillment.
We must, therefore, be on our guard and not trust
the subject’s introspective account, unless it is well
sifted by good circumstantial evidence. It is because
such precautions have not been taken in the
close interrogation of the subject’s actual state
of mind, and because of the deep-rooted psychological
fallacy as to the relation of ideational and perceptual
activities, that the prevalent belief in the
validity of suggested hallucinations has passed unchallenged.
If not for those factors, it would have
been quite evident that the <em>hypnotic and post-hypnotic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
suggested hallucinations are not genuine, but
are essentially spurious. Hypnotic hallucinations,
unlike actual hallucinations, are not really experienced.
Hypnotically suggested hallucinations are
only forms of delusions</em>, attempts to appease the
master hypnotizer of whom the subconscious stands
in awe and fear.</p>

<p>The state of hypnotic subconsciousness is a state
based on the will to conform to the master hypnotizer’s
commands. At bottom the subconscious trance-will
is one of slavish obedience to the authoritative,
fear-inspiring will of the master hypnotizer, whom
the hypnotic subconscious attempts to please and
obey slavishly. The hypnotic state is a fear state
of a primitive type. It is the fear state of the
Damara ox obeying the herd, or the leader of the
herd.</p>

<p>Man is hypnotizable, because he is gregarious,
because he is easily controlled by <em>self-fear</em>, because
he easily falls into a <em>self-less</em> state of complacent
servility. Man, subconscious man, is servile, in
fear of his Lord. The independent, free man is yet
to come.</p>

<br />
THE HYPNOIDAL STATE AND SUPERSTITIONS</h2>


<p>The hypnoidal state into which man is apt to
fall so easily, is well adapted to fear suggestions,
since the fear instinct and the impulse of self-preservation
are present in the subconsciousness, exposed
during trance states to all sorts of fear suggestions
and superstitions. It is during these brief periods
of primitive hypnoidal states that the animal is exposed
to attacks of enemies whose senses become
sharpened to detect the weak spots in the armor
of their victims, immersed in the momentary rest
of the hypnoidal state.</p>

<p>During these periods of repose and passivity or
of sleep stage, the animal can only protect itself
by all kinds of subterfuges, such as hiding in various
inaccessible places, or taking its rest-periods in
shady nooks and corners, or in the darkness of
the night. Each hypnoidal period closely corresponds
to the larval stage of the insect, reposing
in its cocoon,&mdash;the most critical time of the insect
organism, most exposed to the depredations of its
enemies. And still the hypnoidal state is requisite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
to the animal in order to restitute its living matter
and energy which have been wasted during the
active moments of its life activities. Hence the
weakness of the animal depends on the very constitution
of its organism.</p>

<p>The hypnoidal state, although absolutely necessary
in the <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'process of matabolism'">process of metabolism</ins>, is also the moment
of its greatest danger, and the fear instinct
is specially intense at the onset of that hypnoidal
moment, the lowest point of the weakness of the
organism. The animal, after taking all precautions,
is finally paralyzed into temporary immobility
at the risk of its own existence.</p>

<p>The fear instinct determines the nature and
character of rest and sleep. The lower the animal,
the scantier are its means of defense in the
ceaseless struggle for its preservation. The simpler
the animal, the greater and more numerous are the
dangers menacing it with total extinction,&mdash;hence
it must be constantly on its guard. A state of
sleep such as found in the higher animals is rendered
impossible. The sleep must be light, and in snatches,
rapidly passing from rest into waking,&mdash;the characteristic
of the hypnoidal state. The fear instinct
is the controlling factor of sleep and rest.
When we are in danger the sleep is light and in
snatches, and we thus once more revert to an ancient
form of rest and sleep.</p>

<p><em>The insomnia found in cases of neurosis is a reversion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
to primitive rest-states, found in the lower
animals.</em> The insomnia is due to the fear instinct
which keeps dominating the conscious and subconscious
mental activities, a state which has prevailed
in the early stages of animal life. That
is why the sleep of neurotics is unrefreshing and
full of dreams of dangers and accidents, and peopled
with visions of a terrorizing nature. Hence
the neurotic fear of insomnia which is itself the
consequence of the obsession, conscious and subconscious,
of the fear instinct.</p>

<p>In my work on sleep I was greatly impressed
with the place fear holds in animal life existence.
From the lowest representative, such as the insect
to the highest, such as man, fear rules with an iron
hand. Every animal is subject to cataplexy of
fear and to the hypnoidal state itself, the consequence
of fear-adaptations to the external conditions
of a hostile environment. Cataplexy and the consequent
hypnoidal state which paralyze the animal,
depriving it of all defense, are grounded in the
imperfections of living protoplasm.</p>

<p>Man is subject to the hypnoidal periods of
primitive life. It is during those periods that the
shafts of suggestion are most apt to strike his subconsciousness,
divorced as it is during those moments
from the nodding self consciousness. During these
nodding moments of his life he is exposed to harmful
suggestions, since they are apt to arouse the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
fear instinct, the most sensitive of all human instincts.
It seems as if the fear instinct is never
fully asleep, and is the easiest to arouse. It seems
to be watchful or semi-watchful during the most
critical moments of man’s helplessness.</p>

<p>Fear of darkness and fear of invisible foes are
specially strong in man, because of the deeply rooted
fear instinct, but also because of his memories of
accidents and dangers that have befallen him, and
which may befall him. Man’s fears hang round
dark places, gloomy corners and nooks, caves and
forests, and more especially during the darkness
and shades of night, appearing as treacherous
visions and specters of lurking dangers. And still
from the very nature of his being man must rest
and sleep, hence the association of terrors with
night time. He can only overcome his night terrors
by living and sleeping in more or less secure
corners, in the neighborhood of his fellow-beings
who by the mere fact of numbers multiply not only
the means of defense, but actually increase susceptibility
for the scent of danger and possible
speedy defense. In the society of his fellows the
sense organs of the individual are increased by
the presence of others who are in various stages
of vigilance, and hence there is greater protection
against dangers and invisible foes that lurk in the
darkness of night, foes of which primitive man is
in terror of his life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>The fear of the unknown, the mysterious, and
the dark, peoples the mind of primitive man with all
sorts of terrible spectres, ghosts, spirits, goblins,
ghouls, shades, witches, and evil powers, all bent on
mischief, destruction and death. <em>Primitive man suffers
from chronic demonophobia.</em> Fear states are
specially emphasized at night when the “demons”
have the full power for evil, and man is helpless on
account of darkness and sleep which paralyze him.
Hence the terrors of the night, especially when man
is alone, and defenseless.</p>

<p>The fear of solitude comes out strongly in the
intense fear that obsesses man in the gloomy darkness
of the night horrors. Fire and fellow-beings
can alone relieve his night terrors. The fear of
foes, of demons, of evil powers does not abate in
the day, only it is relieved by reason of light, of
association, and of wakefulness. Man, more than
any other animal, is the victim of the fear instinct.
Many tribes, many races of men perished, due to
superstitions and fear obsessions.</p>

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo sapiens</i> is rare. We may agree with
Tarde that <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Homo somnambulis</i> would be a proper
definition of the true mental condition of most
specimens of the human race. For the human
race is still actuated by the principle of “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Credo,
quia absurdum est</i>.” I need not go far to substantiate
the fact that this principle still guides the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
life of the average specimen of civilized humanity.
Spiritualism, theosophy, telepathy, ghost hunting,
astrology, oneiromancy, cheiromancy, Christian
Science, psychoanalytic oneiroscopy employed in
events and situations of individual and social life,
and many other magical practices whose name is
legion, based on the mysteries of communication
with ghosts, spirits, demons, and unknown fearsome
powers, still haunt the credulous mind, obsessed with
conscious and subconscious horrors of the terrible,
invisible spirit world.</p>

<p>Against the fears of diseases, the scares of the
day and terrors of night, civilized man still uses
the magic arts and mysterious, miraculous powers
of the magician, the wizard, the witch, the mental
healer, the shaman, the medicine man, the miracle
man, and the psychoanalyst. Just at present under
my own eyes I witness the pitiful credulity of man,
driven by the terrors and horrors of the fear instinct.
In San Jose, San Diego, in Los Angeles,
and in many other Western “culture” centers mystic
cults hold high carnival, swaying the minds of fear-crazed,
deluded humanity. As typical specimens of
superstitious fears and absurd beliefs, due to the
fear instinct, we may take as illustrations the following
occurrences in the centers of the far West,
obsessed by the aberrations of the fear instinct (I
quote from Los Angeles papers):</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>

<p>“Faith Healer at Los Angeles, Venice, California,
after several wonder cures, orders sun’s rays to be
darkened. ‘Brother Isaiah,’ called by thousands
the ‘Miracle Man,’ claimed to have repeated the
marvel of dimming the sun at Venice yesterday evening.</p>

<p>“At 6 o’clock the disciple of healing by faith
raised his hands and announced that as evidence
of his power he would blot out the brilliant solar
rays. He gazed at the dazzling red ball above
the waters of the Pacific, and his lips moved in low
murmurs.</p>

<p>“‘It is done,’ he said. ‘I have clouded the sun.
All those who have seen this miracle raise your
hands.’ Hundreds of hands waved in the air.</p>

<p>“The first time ‘Brother Isaiah’ claimed to have
dimmed the sun’s rays was at Miracle Hill, when he
had been in Los Angeles but a few days.</p>

<p>“Brother Isaiah stepped to one side of his wooden
platform on the Venice Beach yesterday. He placed
a silver police whistle to his lips and blew. The
piercing crescendo sent a shiver through the tense
mass of humanity which stretched from the sand
back to the ocean walk.” Similar miracles and
cures were carried on by Mrs. Amy McPherson in
San Diego, San Jose, and all along the Pacific coast.</p>

<p>The self-impulse and the fear instinct, in their
intensified forms, are the bane of deluded, neurotic
humanity.</p>

NEUROSIS AND HEREDITY</h2>


<p>The following discussion in the form of questions
and answers may prove of interest to the
physician and to the intelligent layman. The discussion
occurred in the course of correspondence.
A friend of mine thought the subject of sufficient
importance to have it brought to the attention of
the cultured public.</p>

<p>The questions are as follows:</p>

<p>“Are not all neuropathic conditions the results
of a morbid, unstable nervous organism, the basis
of which lies in a faulty heredity?</p>

<p>“Are not weak nerves the cause of hysterical,
neurasthenic and neuropathic affections in general?</p>

<p>“Is not all neurosis due to defective parent
stock?</p>

<p>“If the occasions for fear, as some psychopathologists
claim, were more frequent in primitive times
than now, then the cave men must have had more
psychopathic affections than civilized man.”</p>

<p>To these questions the following answers are
given:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span></p>

<p>Psychopathic diseases are not hereditary&mdash;they
are <em>acquired</em> characteristics, having their origin in
the abnormal, hypertrophied growth of the fear
instinct which is at the root of the primal impulse
of self-preservation. This is proved by psychopathological
studies of clinical cases; and it can be
further demonstrated by experimental work in the
laboratory even in the case of animals. “Weak
nerves,” “a run down, exhausted nervous system,”
whatever the terms may mean, may overlap psychopathic
conditions, but the two are by no means
equivalent, much less identical. Psychopathic, psychoneurotic
states are not “weak nerves” or
“fatigued nerves.” Above all, there is no need to
obscure the matter and resort to the much abused,
mystical and mystifying factor of heredity. It is
easy to shift all blame on former generations, when,
in most cases, the fault is close at hand, namely,
a debased environment, a defective training, and a
vicious education.</p>

<p>There is good reason to believe that primitive
man had a far greater tendency to dissociation,
to subconscious psychopathic states than modern
man. Even the Middle Ages teem with psychopathic
mental epidemics of the most puerile type.
In the course of evolution, social and individual,
this neurotic, psychopathic tendency has gradually
diminished, but has never been completely eliminated.
Increase of knowledge, better education, the increase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of social safeguards, sanitary and hygienic
conditions with consequent increase of safety from
dangers, have all helped materially in decreasing
the occasions for the cultivation of the fear instinct.</p>

<p>Under the rigorous conditions of primitive life
individuals who have been unfortunate and have
become affected with mental troubles and emotional
afflictions of the fear instinct are mercilessly exterminated
by the process of tribal and social selection.
Each generation weeds out the individuals
who have been unfortunate enough to fall under
unfavorable circumstances and have become mentally
sick, suffering from acquired psychopathic disturbances.
In primitive life the crippled, the
maimed, the wounded, the sick fall by the way, and
are left to perish a miserable death. In fact, the
less fortunate, the wounded and the stricken in
the battle of life, are attacked by their own companions,&mdash;they
are destroyed by the ruthless, social
brute. The gregarious brute has no sympathy with
the pains and sufferings of the injured and the
wounded. The faint and the ailing are destroyed
by the herd.</p>

<p>Civilization, on the other hand, tends more and
more towards the preservation of psychopathic individuals.
We no longer kill our sick and our weak,
nor do we abandon them to a miserable, painful
death,&mdash;we take care of them, and cure them. Moreover,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
we prevent pathogenic factors from exercising
a harmful, malign social selection of the “fit.”
We do our best to free ourselves from the blind,
merciless, purposeless selection, produced by pathogenic
micro-organisms and by other noxious
agencies. We learn to improve the external environment.</p>

<p>We do not condemn people to death because they
are infected with smallpox, typhus, typhoid bacilli,
or because of an infected appendix. We no longer
regard them as sinful, unclean, accursed, and
tabooed. We vaccinate, inoculate, operate, and
attempt to cure them. By sanitary and prophylactic
measures we attempt to prevent the very occurrence
of epidemics. Our valuation of individuals
is along lines widely different from those of the
stone age and cave man. We value a Pascal, a
Galileo, a Newton, a Darwin, a Pasteur, and a
Helmholtz far above a Milo of Croton or an African
Johnson.</p>

<p>Civilization is in need of refined, delicate and
sensitive organizations, just as it is in need of
galvanometers, chronometers, telephones, wireless
apparatuses, and various chemical reagents of a
highly delicate character. We are beginning to
appreciate delicate mechanisms and sensitive organizations.
We shall also learn to train and guard
our sensitive natures until they are strong and
resistant to the incident forces of an unfavorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
environment. The recognition, the diagnosis, and
the preservation of psychopathic individuals account
for the apparent increase of neurotics in civilized
communities.</p>

<p>It may be well to add that, although occasions
for sudden, intense, overwhelming fears are not
so prevalent in civilized societies as they are in
primitive savage communities, the worries, the
anxieties, the various forms of slow grinding fears
of a vague, marginal, subconscious character present
in commercial and industrial nations, are even
more effective in the production of psychopathic
states than are the isolated occasions of intense
frights in the primitive man of the paleolithic or
neolithic periods.</p>

<br />
NEUROSIS AND EUGENICS</h2>


<p>In my work on Psychopathology I lay special
stress on the fact that the psychopathic individual
has a predisposition to dissociative states. Early
experiences and training in childhood enter largely
into the formation of such a predisposition. Still,
there is no doubt that a sensitive nervous system
is required&mdash;a brain susceptible to special stimuli
of the external environment. This, of course, does
not mean that the individual must suffer from stigmata
of degeneration. On the contrary, it is quite
possible, and in many patients we actually find it
to be so, that the psychopathic individual may be
even of a superior organization. <em>It is the sensitivity
and the delicacy of nervous organization that make
the system susceptible to injurious stimulations, to
which a lower form of organization could be subjected
with impunity.</em></p>

<p>An ordinary clock can be handled roughly without
disturbance of its internal workings, but the
delicate and complicated mechanism of a chronometer
requires careful handling and special, favorable
conditions for its normal functioning. Unfavorable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
conditions are more apt to affect a highly
complex mechanism than a roughly made instrument.
It is quite probable that it is the superior
minds and more highly complex mental and nervous
organizations that are subject to psychopathic
states or states of dissociation. Of course, unstable
minds are also subject to dissociative states, but
we must never forget the fact that highly organized
brains, on account of their very complexity, are
apt to become unstable under unfavorable conditions.
A predisposition to dissociation may occur
either in degenerative minds or in minds superior to
the average. <em>Functional psychosis requires a long
history of dissociated, subconscious shocks, suffered
by a highly or lowly organized nervous system, a
long history dating back to early childhood.</em></p>

<p>As Mosso puts it: “The vivid impression of a
strong emotion may produce the same effect as a
blow on the head or some physical shock.” We
may, however, say that no functional psychosis,
whether somatopsychosis or psychoneurosis, can
ever be produced simply by physical shocks. <em>In
all functional psychoses there must be a mental
background, and it is the mental background alone
that produces the psychosis and determines the character
of the psychopathic state.</em></p>

<p><em>Fear is an important factor in the etiology of
psychopathic affections which include somatopsychoses
and psychoneuroses.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span></p>

<p>To regard fear as “error,” as do some sectarians,
is absurd, and is certainly unscientific. Abnormal
fear which is the basis of all functional nervous
or psychopathic maladies, is essentially a pathological
process affecting the organs in general and the
nervous system in particular in as definite a way
as the invasion and infection of the organism by
various species of bacteria, bacilli, and other micro-organisms
which attack the individual during his
lifetime.</p>

<p>Like infectious diseases, the deviations, abnormalities,
and excesses of the fear instinct are <em>acquired</em>
by the individual in the course of his relations
with the external environment, and are as
real and substantial as are syphilis, smallpox, diphtheria,
cholera, and the bubonic plague. To regard
them as imaginary or to relegate them to
the action of Providence or to heredity is theoretically
a misconception, and practically a great
danger to humanity.</p>

<p>There is nowadays a veritable craze for heredity
and eugenics. Biology is misconceived, misinterpreted,
and misapplied to social problems, and to
individual needs and ailments. Everything is ascribed
to heredity, from folly and crime to scratches
and sneezes. The goddess Heredity is invoked at
each flea-bite&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in morsu pulicis Deum invocare</i>.</p>

<p>Even war is supposed to be due to the omnipotent
deity of Heredity. Superior races by their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
patriotism and loyalty destroy the weak and the
helpless, and relentlessly exterminate all peaceful
tribes. Such warlike stock comes of superior clay.
The dominant races have some miraculous germ-plasm,
special “unit characters,” wonderful dominant
“units” which, like a precious heritage, these
races transmit unsullied and untarnished to their
descendants.</p>

<p>Wars, carnage, butcheries make for progress, culture,
and evolution. Our boasted civilization with
its “scientific” business thoroughness and its ideal
of “efficiency” attempts to carry into effect this
quasi-evolutionary doctrine&mdash;this apotheosis of
brute force under the aegis of science. The eugenic
belief is really a recrudescence of the ancient savage
superstition of the magic virtues of noble blood
and of divine king stock.</p>

<p>All nervous, mental, neuropathic, and psychopathic
maladies are supposed to be a matter of
heredity. If people are poor, ignorant, superstitious,
stupid, degraded, brutal, and sick, the eugenists
unhesitatingly put it all down to poor stock.</p>

<p>The eugenic remedy is as simple as it is believed
to be efficacious: Introduce by legislation “efficient”
laws favoring “eugenic” marriage, and teach the
masses control of births. The select and chosen
stock alone should multiply&mdash;the millennium is then
bound to come. Such is the doctrine of our medico-biological
sages.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span></p>

<p>“Scientific” farmers and breeders of vegetables,
fruits, and cattle are regarded as competent judges
of human “breeders.” Agriculturists and horticulturists
set themselves up as advisers in “the business
of raising good crops of efficient children.”
Bachelors, spinsters, and the childless generally, are
specially versed in eugenic wisdom and pedagogics.</p>

<p>All social ills and individual complaints are referred
to one main source&mdash;heredity. With the introduction
of eugenic legislation, with the sterilization
of the socially unfit, among whom the greatest
men and women may be included, with the breeding
of good “orthodox, common stock,” and with
eugenic Malthusian control of births, all evil and
diseases on earth will cease, while the Philistine
“superman” will reign supreme forevermore.</p>

<p>In the Middle Ages all diseases and epidemics,
all wars, all social and private misfortunes were
considered as visitations of Divine wrath. The fear
instinct held sway, terrorizing poor, deluded humanity.
In modern times our would-be eugenic
science refers all ills of the flesh and woes of the
mind to an outraged Heredity. The dark ages
had resort to prayers, fasts, and penitence, while
our age childishly pins its faith to the miraculous
virtues and rejuvenating, regenerative powers of
legislative eugenic measures, and to the eugenic
Malthusian control of births.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>

<p>Our scientists in eugenics gather hosts of facts,
showing by elaborate statistical figures that the
family history of neurotics reveals stigmata of degeneration
in the various members of the family.
The eugenic inquirers do not stop for a moment to
think over the fact that the same sort of evidence
can be easily brought in the case of most
people. In fact, the eugenists themselves, when inquiring
into the pedigree of talent and genius, invariably
find somewhere in the family some form
of disease or degeneration. This sort of “scientific”
evidence leads some eugenic speculators, without
their noticing the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reductio ad absurdum</i>, to the
curious conclusion or generalization that degeneration
is present in the family history of the best and
the worst representatives of the human race.</p>

<p>The so-called scientific method of the eugenists
is faulty, in spite of the rich display of colored
plates, stained tablets, glittering biological speculations,
brilliant mathematical formulae, and complicated
statistical calculations. The eugenists pile
Ossa on Pelion of facts by the simple method of
enumeration which Bacon and the thinkers coming
after him have long ago condemned as puerile and
futile. From the savage’s belief in sympathetic,
imitative magic with its consequent superstitions,
omens, and taboos down to the articles of faith
and dogmas of the eugenists, we find the same faulty,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
primitive thought, guided by the puerile, imbecile
method of simple enumeration, and controlled by the
wisdom of the logical <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">post hoc, ergo propter hoc</i>.</p>

<p>What would we say of the medical man who should
claim that measles, mumps, cholera, typhoid fever,
yellow fever, malaria, tetanus, and various other
infectious diseases are hereditary by quoting learnedly
long tables of statistics to the effect that for
several generations members of the same family suffered
from the same infectious diseases? What would
we say of the medical advice forbidding marriage to
individuals whose family history reveals the presence
of exanthemata? We stamp out epidemics not
by eugenic measures, but by the cleansing of infectious
filth, and by the extermination of pathogenic
micro-organisms.</p>

<p>Every human being has a predisposition to smallpox,
cholera, tetanus, bubonic plague, typhus fever,
malaria, and to like infectious diseases, but there
is no inherent necessity for everyone to fall a victim
to the action of pathogenic organisms, if the
preventive and sanitary conditions are good and
proper. No one is immune against the action of
bullets, cannon balls, shells, and torpedoes, or to
the action of various poisons, organic and inorganic,
but one is not doomed by fate to be killed
by them, if one does not expose himself to their
deadly action.</p>

<p>Every living organism is, by the very nature of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
its cellular tissues, predisposed to wounding by
sharp instruments, or to the burning action of fire,
but this does not mean an inherent organic weakness
to which the organism must necessarily submit
and perish. We are all of us predisposed to get
injured and possibly killed, when we fall down from
a high place, or when we are run over by an automobile
or by a locomotive, but there is no fatalistic
necessity about such accidents, if care is taken
that they should not occur.</p>

<p>We may be predisposed to neurosis by the very
nature of complexity, delicacy, and sensitivity inherent
in the structure of a highly organized nervous
system, and still we may remain healthy and strong
all our life long, provided we know how to keep away
from noxious agencies. The creed of the inevitable
fatality of neurosis is as much of a superstition as
the Oriental belief in the fatalism of infectious diseases,
plagues, and accidents of all kinds. Such
fatalistic superstitions are dangerous, fatal, because
they distract the attention from the actual cause
and from the requisite prophylactic measures.</p>

<p>We go far afield in search for the remote source
of our troubles, when the cause is close at hand.
We need only open our eyes to see the filth of our
towns, the foul, loathsome slums of our cities, the
miserable training, the wretched education given
to our children, in order to realize at a glance the
source of our ills and ailments. We should lay the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
guilt at the door of our social order. We starve
our young. We starve our children physically and
mentally. We piously sacrifice our tender children
and the flower of our youth to the greedy, industrial
Moloch of a military, despotic, rapacious plutocracy.</p>

<p>Witness semi-civilized Europe with its lauded
culture brutally shedding the blood of its youth
and manhood on the altar of commercial patriotism!
It is not heredity, it is the vicious conditions of life
that stunt the physical, nervous, and mental growth
of our young generation. When we are confronted
with the miserable, degraded, crippled forms of
our life, we fall back cheerfully on some remote
grandparent, and credulously take refuge in the
magic panacea of eugenics.</p>

<p>The practical aspect is clear. Psychopathic
neurosis in its two varieties, somatopsychosis and
psychoneurosis, is not hereditary, but <em>acquired</em>. We
should not shift the blame on former generations
and have resort to eugenics, but we must look to
the improvement of mental hygienic conditions of
early childhood, and to the proper education of the
individual.</p>

<p>It is easy to put the blame on grandparents,&mdash;they
are dead and cannot defend themselves. Could
they arise from their graves, they could tell some
bitter truths to their descendants who are ready to
shift responsibility to other people’s shoulders. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
is about time to face the truth fairly and squarely,
a truth which is brought out by recent investigations
in psychopathology, that no matter where the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fons
et origo</i> of neurosis be, whether in self-preservation
and its accompanying fear instinct, the condition
of life primordial, or in the other forms of self-preservation,
<em>the formation of psychopathic neurosis
with all its characteristic protean symptoms is
not hereditary, but acquired. Neurosis arises within
the life cycle of the individual; it is due to faulty
training and harmful experience of early child life.</em></p>

<p>Future medicine will be largely prophylactic, preventive,
sanitary, hygienic, dietetic. What holds
true of medicine in general holds true of that particular
branch of it that deals with neurosis. The
treatment will become largely prophylactic, preventive,
educational, or pedagogic. It is time that
the <em>medical and teaching profession should realize
that functional neurosis is not congenital, not inborn,
not hereditary, but is the result of a defective,
fear-inspiring education in early child life</em>.</p>

<p>The psychopathic diathesis can be overcome by
dispelling the darkness of ignorance and credulity
with their false fears and deceptive hopes, above
all, by fortifying the critical, controlling, guiding
consciousness. Let in sun and air into the obscure
cobwebbed regions of the child and man. The gloom
and the ghosts of the fear instinct are dispersed
by the light of reason.</p>

<br />
PRIMITIVE FEARS</h2>


<p>Various authorities in Ethnology and Anthropology
concur in their description and testimony as to
the superstitious fears that obsess primitive man.</p>

<p>Professor Baldwin Spencer, the anthropologist,
writes of the Australian aborigines that they have
“an intense belief in evil magic. The natives have
no idea of disease or pain as being due to anything
but evil magic, except that which is caused by an
actual accident which they can see.... Anything
they do not understand they associate with evil
magic.... You have only to tell a native that
he is the victim of evil magic, and he succumbs at
once, and can only be cured by the exercise of
counter magic.</p>

<p>“The number of supernatural beings feared by
aborigines of Australia is exceedingly great. For
not only are the heavens peopled with such, but the
whole face of the country swarms with them; every
thicket, most watering places abound with evil
spirits. In like manner, every natural phenomenon
is believed to be the work of demons, none of which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
seem to be of a benign nature, one and all apparently
striving to do all imaginable mischief to the
poor black fellow.”</p>

<p>The same is true of the negro. “The negro is
wont to regard the whole world around him as peopled
with envious beings, to whom he imputes every
misfortune that happens to him, and from whose
harmful influence he seeks to protect himself by
all kinds of magic means.” “The religion of the
Bolok (of the Upper Congo River),” writes an observer,
“has its basis in their fear of those numerous
invisible spirits which surround them on every side,
and are constantly trying to compass them in their
sickness, misfortune and death; and the Boloki’s
sole object in practising their religion is to cajole,
or appease, cheat or conquer or kill those spirits
that trouble them, by their Nganga (medicine men),
their rites, their ceremonies, and their charms. If
there were no evil spirits to circumvent there would
be no need of medicine men and their charms....
The Boloki folk believe that they are surrounded
by spirits which try to thwart them at every twist
and turn, and to harm them every hour of day and
night.... I never met among them a man daring
enough to go at night through the forest that divided
Monsembe from the upper villages even though
a large reward was offered. Their invariable reply
was: ‘There are too many spirits in the bush and
forest.’ The spirits whom the people dread so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
much are the mingoli, or disembodied souls of the
dead; the life of the Boloki is described as ‘one
long drawn out fear of what the mingoli may next
do to them.’ Those dangerous beings dwell everywhere,
land and water are full of them; they are
ever ready to pounce on the living and carry them
away, or to smite them with disease, and kill them....
The belief in witchcraft affects their lives in
a vast number of ways. It regulates their actions,
modifies their mode of thought and speech, controls
their conduct towards each other, causes
cruelty and callousness in a people not naturally
cruel, and sets the various members of a family
against each other.... Belief in witches is interwoven
into the very fiber of every Bantu speaking
man and woman; and the person who does not
believe in them is a monster, a witch to be killed.”</p>

<p>The fear of evil spirits, the fear of witchcraft,
and the fear of malicious spiritual agencies have
been the pests of credulous, fear-obsessed humanity
in all the ages of its existence. The crusades, and
religious wars have shown us the blight suffered by
humanity, obsessed by the impulse of self-preservation
and the fear instinct. <em>Fear</em> or <em>pretended Love</em>
of the great spirit, under whatever name, is used
for the avoidance of fears and evils.</p>

<p>Sir E. F. im Thurn describes the Indian of Guiana
as haunted by the omnipresence of malicious ghosts
and spirits. “The whole world of the Indian swarms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
with these beings. If by a mental effort, we could
for a moment revert to a similar mental position,
we should find ourselves surrounded everywhere by
a host of harmful beings.... It is not therefore,
wonderful that the Indian fears to move beyond
the light of his camp-fire after dark ... nor is
it wonderful that occasionally the air round the
settlement seems to the Indian to grow so full of
beings, that a sorcerer is employed.”</p>

<p>The Indians of Paraguay “live in constant dread
of supernatural beings and if nothing else contributed
to make their life miserable, this ever present
dread would be in itself quite sufficient to rob
it of most of its joys.”</p>

<p>Professor Powell writes of the Indians: “The
Indians believed that diseases were caused by unseen
evil beings and by witchcraft, and every cough,
every toothache, every headache, every fever, every
boil and every wound, in fact all their ailments were
attributed to such a cause. Their so-called medical
practice was a horrible system of sorcery and to
such superstition human life was sacrificed on an
enormous scale....”</p>

<p>Similarly, the malignant spirits of the Maori are
“so numerous as to surround the living in crowds.”
The Maori claims: “the spirits throng like mosquitoes,
ever watching to inflict harm.” The Melanesian
“sees himself surrounded at every step by
evil spirits and their influences.” The Papuans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
“people land and sea with mysterious, malignant
powers which take up their abode in stones and trees
or in men, and cause all kinds of misfortunes, especially
sickness and death.” The Bakua of New
Guinea are in constant fear of spirits.... “Of
forest spirits the number is infinite; for it is above
all in the mysterious darkness, the tangled wilderness
of the virgin forests that the spirits love to
dwell.... The spirits are never bent on good, they
live in evil places. At night-fall the native hears
the voices of the spirits, they make inroads into
human habitations, and drive man crazy.”</p>

<p>In Java, the people are firmly convinced that “the
number of spirits is innumerable, they are a source
of fear and anxiety.” The natives of Sumatra are
possessed of “fear of unknown powers.... Every
misfortune bespeaks the ill-will of hostile spirits.
The whole world is a meeting place of demons.” The
Batakas “live in perpetual fear of evil spirits.”</p>

<p>Professor M. Williams writes of the Hindoos:
“The great majority of the inhabitants of India
are, from the cradle to the burning ground, victims
of a form of mental disease which is best explained
by the term <em>demonophobia</em>. They are
haunted and oppressed by a perpetual dread of
demons. They are firmly convinced that evil spirits
of all kinds, from malignant fiends to mischievous
imps and elves, are ever on the watch to harm,
harass and torment them, to cause plague, sickness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
famine, and disaster, to impede, injure and
mar every good work. The worship of at least
ninety per cent of the people of India in the present
day is a worship of fear. The simple truth is
that evil of all kinds, difficulties, dangers and disasters,
famines, diseases, pestilences and death, are
thought by an ordinary Hindoo to proceed from
demons, or more properly speaking, from devils, and
from devils alone.” “The underlying principle (of
the religion of the Kacharis of Assam) is characteristically
one of fear or dread.”</p>

<p>“The Thibetans,” writes an observer, “are thorough-going
demon worshippers. In every nook,
path, big tree, rock, spring, waterfall and lake there
lurks a devil,&mdash;for which reason few individuals will
venture out alone after dark. The sky, the ground,
the house, the field, the country, have each their
special demons; and sickness is always attributed to
malign demoniacal influence.”</p>

<p>The Burmese, the Laosians of Siam, the Thay of
Indo-China are in all their activities controlled by
the fear instinct which is at the bottom of all their
beliefs. “The Thay cannot take a single step without
meeting a demon on the path.... Spirits
watch him, ready to punish negligence, and he is
afraid. <em>Fear is not only for him, the beginning of
wisdom, it is the whole of his wisdom.</em>”</p>

<p>The Koreans may be regarded as the most superstitious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
people among the Orientals. Before me
lies a Korean book full of superstitions which can
only be matched in their absurdities with those of
Australian aborigines who, in their savage culture,
belong to the paleolithic period. The whole course
of the Korean’s life is controlled to the very minutiae
by the terrors and horrors of demoniacal,
invisible, deadly, malignant powers of demons, spirits,
ghosts, hobgoblins, specters, and witches. According
to the Korean belief the earth is a pandemonium
in which witches and evil spirits hold high carnival.</p>

<p>J. M. de Groot writes “In Korean belief, earth,
air, and sea are peopled by demons. They haunt
every umbrageous tree, shady ravine, spring and
mountain crest.... They make a sport of human
destinies. They are on every roof, ceiling, oven and
beam. They fill the chimney, shed, the living room,
the kitchen, they are on every shelf and jar. In
thousands they waylay the traveler as he leaves
his home, beside him, behind him, dancing in front of
him, whirring over his head, crying out upon him
from air, earth, and water. They are numbered by
thousands of billions, and it has been well said
that their ubiquity is an unholy travesty of Divine
Omnipresence. This belief, and it seems to
be the only one he possesses, keeps the Korean in
a perpetual state of nervous apprehension, it surrounds
him with indefinite terrors, and it may be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
truly said of him that he passes the time of his
sojourning here in fear.... The spirits keep the
Korean in bondage from birth to death.”</p>

<p>Im Bang, a Korean writer on Korean beliefs,
has a characteristic story of a poor relative of some
Korean dignitary. This poor relative of the high
official once a year gathered hundreds of thousands
of spirits whom he checked off, so as to keep their
malignant disposition under control. And this
gentleman was but one of the many clerks; he was
but one census man of the vast bureaucratic spiritistic
machinery for the regulation and control of
evil demons.</p>

<p>The same holds true of the other tribes in Asia.
Thus the Gyliaks think that all the places on earth
are filled with malicious demoniacal agencies. Similarly,
the Koryaks on the Amoor are terrorized
by the malignancy of evil spirits that dog their
steps. W. Jochelson tells of the Koryaks that
“when visiting the houses to cause diseases and to
kill people, they (the spirits or demons) enter from
under the ground.... They are invisible to human
beings, they are sometimes so numerous in
houses that they sit on the people, and fill up all
corners.... With hammers and axes they knock
people over their heads and cause headache. They
bite, and cause swellings. They shoot invisible
arrows which stick in the body causing death. The
demons tear out pieces of flesh from people, thus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
causing sores and wounds to form on the body.”
The same spirit of fear of the invisible and of the
mysterious, fear of evil powers, controlling the fate
of man, constitutes the central belief of almost every
primitive tribe, semi-civilized, ancient, as well as
modern nation. They are all controlled by the fundamental
instinct of life&mdash;the fear instinct.</p>

<p>The Semitic scholar, R. H. Harper, writes of
the Assyrians and Babylonians as follows: “There
is no place in the universe where evil spirits can
not penetrate. Every manner of evil and disaster
is ascribed to them, from pestilence, fever, and the
scorching wind of the desert, down to the trifles
of life,&mdash;a quarrel, a headache, a broken dish, or a
bad dream. They walk the street, slip into the door,
get into the food, in short, are everywhere, and
the danger from their presence is always imminent....
Corresponding to a widespread belief in demons
was a similar belief in witchcraft. It was not at
all strange that the demons, who worked in every
possible corner of the universe, should take possession
of human beings....”</p>

<p>The tablets excavated in the imperial library of
Ashurbanipal show the spirit of the people even
of the highest classes debased with delusions and
religious hallucinations due to self-preservation and
fear instinct, so dominant in man who, when common-sense
departs from him, may be regarded as
the <em>irrational animal par excellence</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>

<p>We may give the following illustration taken from
one of the many tablets of the Shurpu series:</p>

<p>“The evil spirits like grass have covered the earth.
To the four winds they spread brilliancy like fire,
they send forth flames. The people living in dwellings
they torment, their bodies they afflict. In city
and country they bring moaning, small and great
they make to lament. Man and woman they put
in bonds, and fill with cries of woe. Man they fall
upon and cover him like a garment. In heaven and
earth like a tempest they rain; they rush on in
pursuit. They fill him with poison, his hands they
bind, his sides they crush.”</p>

<p>According to the ancient rabbis, a man should
not drink water by night, for thus he exposes himself
to the Shavriri, demons of blindness. What
then should he do if he is thirsty? If there be another
man with him, let him rouse him up and say:
“I am thirsty,” but if he be alone, let him tap upon
the lid of the jug (to make the demon fancy there
is some one with him), and addressing him by his
own name, let him say: “Thy mother bid thee beware
of the Shavriri, vriri, riri, ri.” Rashi, a
mediaeval commentator, says that by this incantation
the demon gradually contracts and vanishes as
the sound of the word Shavriri decreases.</p>

<p>The ancient rabbis instruct that “no one should
venture out at night time on Wednesday or Saturday,
for Agrath, the daughter of the demon Machloth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
roams about accompanied by eighteen myriads
of evil demons, each one of which has power to
destroy.” The rabbis claim that the air, land and
sea are full of demons, all bent on evil and destruction
of man. In this respect the learned rabbis differ
but little from the superstitious Koreans and Australian
savages. The rabbis warn the pious Jew
that “should he forget to fold his prayer cover,
he is to shake it thoroughly next morning, in order
to get rid of the evil spirits that have harbored
there during the night.” The evil spirits are infinite
in number. Thus the Talmudic authorities
are in full accord with the ancient Babylonians,
Assyrians, and with the lowest savages, ancient
and modern, obsessed by the fear of spirits, by
Demonophobia.</p>

<p>One cannot help agreeing with the English anthropologist,
Frazer, who after his study of the
subject, arrives at the following conclusion: “In
India from the earliest times down to the present
day the real religion of the common folk appears always
to have been a belief in a vast multitude of
spirits of whom many, if not most, are mischievous
and harmful. As in Europe beneath a superficial
layer of Christianity a faith in magic and witchcraft,
in ghosts and goblins has always survived
and even flourished among the weak and the ignorant
(and apparently cultivated) so it has been
and so it is in the East (and we may say also in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
the West). Brahmanism, Buddhism, Islam may
come and go, but the belief in magic and demons
remains unshaken through them all, and, if we may
judge of the future from the past, it is likely to
survive the rise and fall of other historical religions.
For the great faiths of the world, just in
so far as they are the outcome of superior intelligence,
of extraordinary fervor of aspiration after
the ideal, fail to touch and move the common man.
They make claims upon his intellect and his heart,
to which neither the one nor the other is capable of
responding. With the common herd who compose
the great bulk of every people, the new religion is
accepted only in outward show.... They yield
a dull assent to it with their lips, but in their heart
they never abandon their old superstitions (and
fears of evil and mysterious miraculous agencies);
in these they cherish a faith such as they can never
repose in the creed which they nominally profess;
and to these, in the trials and emergencies of life,
they have recourse as to infallible remedies.” And
he quotes Maxwell to the effect that “The Buddhists
in Ceylon, in times of sickness and danger ... turn
to demons, feared and reverenced in the same
way as do ‘the Burmese, Talaings, and Malays.’”</p>

<p>The Jews firmly believed in demoniacal agencies.
“When the even was become, they brought unto
Him many that were possessed with devils; and He
cast out the spirits with His word, and healed all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
that were sick.” “And in the synagogue there was
a man which had a spirit of an unclean devil; and
he cried out with a loud voice.” “And devils also
came out of many ..., and He rebuking them
suffered them not to speak.” “And there was a
herd of many swine feeding on the mountains....
Then went the devils out of the man, and entered
into the swine, and the herd ran violently down a
steep place, and were choked.” “Casting out devils”
was a sure proof of divine mission.</p>

<p>Perhaps a quotation from the Talmud will make
clear the fear of demons which obsesses the Jew:
Abba Benjamin says, “if the eye were permitted
to see the malignant spirits that beset us, we could
not rest on account of them.” Abai, another sage,
says: “They outnumber us, they surround us as
the heaped up soil in our garden plots.” Rav Hunna
says: “Every one has a thousand on his left side
and ten thousand on his right.” Rava claims: “The
crowding at the schools is caused by their (demons)
pushing in; they cause the weariness which the rabbis
experience in their knees, and even tear their clothes
by hustling against them. If one would discover
traces of their presence, let him sift some ashes upon
the floor at his bedside, and next morning he will
see their footmarks as of fowls on the surface. But
if one would see the demons themselves, he must burn
to ashes the after-birth of a first born black kitten,
the offspring of a first-born black cat, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
put a little of the ashes into his eyes, and he will
not fail to see the demons.”</p>

<p>In the words of Lord Avebury, the archeologist,
“the savage is a prey to constant fears....
Savages never know but what they may be placing
themselves in the power of these terrible enemies (the
demons); and it is not too much to say that the
horrible dread of unknown evil hangs like a thick
cloud over savage life and embitters every pleasure.”</p>

<p>In our modern times the preachers, the revivalists,
the pulpit, appeal to fear and to hell in order
to keep their flock in the fold. Fear of eternal damnation
for infidels is the war cry of religion.</p>

<p>Professor Dreslar elicited from 875 California
normal school students four-fifths of whom were
young women, 3225 confessions of belief in superstitions....
“How thin is the veneer of culture
over that great mass of irrational predisposition
which in the hour of fear and excitement resumes
control of the popular mind, and leads on to folly
and ruin!” (Ross).</p>

<p>Buckle is right in pointing out the significant fact
that superstition is found in any walk of life in
which risk or danger predominates. Sailors are
more superstitious than landsmen, while farmers and
business people, especially gamblers and speculators,
are more superstitious than industrial workers.
Similarly Cumont is right in ascribing the superstitions
of soldiers as due to risks and dangers of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>

<p>After the great world war one notices the rise
of all sorts of superstitions. Superstitions and
fear are close companions. A modern historian
does not hesitate to declare that “Europe is held
in hate, because the nations fear each other....
What sentiment has dug the ditch separating Russia
from the rest of the world? It is fear. The states
of Western Europe, which the Soviets regard as
their persecutors, think themselves menaced in their
turn by the Soviet republic.” The Great War was
produced by self-preservation and fear. The world
is still in the grip of the fear instinct.</p>

<p>The Bible claims: Fear of the Lord is the beginning
of wisdom. The Latin poet declares:
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Primus in orbe deos fecit timor</i>. The real state of
things is: <em>Self and fear are the Lords of life</em>, individual
and social.</p>

<p>Bacon in his essay “On the Wisdom of the
Ancients,” with his clear insight has stated the
matter succinctly: “In the Panic terrors there is set
forth a very wise doctrine; for by the nature of
things <em>all living creatures are endued with a certain
fear and dread</em>, the office of which is to preserve
their life and existence, and to avoid or repel
approaching mischief. But the same nature knows
not how to keep just measure,&mdash;but together with
salutary fears ever mingles vain and empty ones;
insomuch that <em>all things (if one could see into the
heart of them) are quite full of Panic terrors; human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
things most of all</em>; so infinitely tossed and troubled
as they are with superstition (which is in truth nothing
but a Panic terror), especially in seasons of
hardship, anxiety, and adversity.”</p>

<br />
THE HERD AND THE SUBCONSCIOUS</h2>


<p>Superstitious terrors are by no means confined to
race; they are common to all races. For example,
among the aborigines of Australia a native will die
after the infliction of even the most superficial wound,
if he is scared by the suggestion that the weapon
which inflicted the wound has been sung over, and
thus endowed with magical virtue. He simply lies
down, refuses food, and pines away.</p>

<p>Similarly among some of the Indian tribes of
Brazil, if the medicine-man predicted the death of
anyone who had offended him, “the wretch took to
his hammock instantly in such full expectation of
dying, that he would neither eat nor drink, and the
prediction was effectually executed.”</p>

<p>Speaking of certain African races Major Leonard
observes: “I have seen more than one hardened old
Haussa soldier dying steadily and by inches, because
he believed himself to be bewitched; so that no nourishment
or medicines that were given to him had
the slightest effect either to check the mischief or
to improve his condition in any way, and nothing was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
able to divert him from a fate which he considered
inevitable.</p>

<p>“In the same way, and under very similar conditions,
I have seen Kru-men and others die, in spite
of every effort that was made to save them, simply
because they had made up their minds, not (as we
thought at the time) to die, but that being in the
clutch of malignant demons they were bound to die.”</p>

<p>The gregarious individual must obey the master
leader on pain of death. In gregarious life the
whole pack attacks the disobedient individual for
challenging the chief, king, priest, the god-man, the
lord of the horde. Obedience is a virtue, disobedience
is a mortal sin, affecting the whole horde, hence
a horrible death of the sinner is the sole punishment.
The independent personality is inhibited, the individual
falls into a state of social somnambulism, and
the will-less, self-less subconscious, a semblance of
personality, charged with self-preservation and fear
instinct, obeys the commands of the master leader
who is often a brutal type, a Nero, a Domitian, a
Caracalla, a Caligula, a John the Terrible.</p>

<p>In a society where the socio-static press is always
at work, where political pressure is far stronger
than even in the ancient despotic monarchies, where
a class government is in possession of all modern improvements,
where gray uniformity and drowsy
monotony reign supreme, obedience must be the rule.
Blind, stupid obedience, that slavish obedience which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
is peculiar to somnambulic subjects, characterizes
such societies.</p>

<p>Servility is well illustrated by the following historical
incident: Prince Sougorsky, ambassador to Germany
in 1576, fell sick <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> in Courland. The
duke of the province often inquired as to his health.
The reply was always the same: “My health matters
nothing, provided the sovereign’s prospers.”
The duke, surprised, said, “How can you serve a
tyrant with so much zeal?” He replied, “We Russians
are always devoted to our Czars, good or cruel.
My master (Ivan the Terrible) impaled a man of
mark for a slight fault, who for twenty-four hours,
in his dying agonies, talked with his family, and
without ceasing kept repeating, ‘Great God, protect
the Czar!’”</p>

<p>The same is true of modern class societies where
the Demos is the despot. God preserve the Demos!
When the business demon of the Demos requires sacrifice,
self immolation, anticipate his order. Pray
for the Demos; Great God, protect the greedy
Demos! The Demos is my Lord, to him is due my
servile loyalty.</p>

<p>It is interesting to observe that the superstitious,
the savage, the negro, and the soldier are excellent
subjects for hypnotic purposes. Soldiers as experiments
show, have a strong predisposition to hypnotic
states. I was told by Professor Münsterberg
that the hypnotic predisposition was strongly developed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
in the German soldier. M. Liebault experimented
on ten hundred and twelve persons, and found
only twenty-seven refractory. Berenheim remarks
on this that “It is necessary to take into account
the fact that M. Liebault operates chiefly upon the
common people.”</p>

<p>The great pressure exerted on the lower social
strata, and especially on soldiers, the dull monotony
of their life, the habit of strict obedience to command,
predisposes them to social subconscious automatisms,&mdash;to
the formation of mobs, clubs, unions,
lodges, associations, parties, clans, sects, mobocracies.
In all such organizations there is present the
same servile spirit&mdash;the impersonal self and the gregarious
fear instinct&mdash;the basis of subconscious,
social somnambulism.</p>

<p>Man is a social somnambulist, he lives, dreams,
and obeys with his eyes open. Whenever the impulse
of self-preservation gets a special grip on the gregarious
individual, when he becomes wild with terror
in the bosom of the herd, then he may be regarded
as a psychopathic victim.</p>

<p>The historian of the future will represent our age
as dark, barbaric, savage, an age of the cruel Napoleonic
wars, of commercial crises, financial panics,
religious revivals, vicious, brutal, savage world wars,&mdash;mobs,
crazes, plagues, social pests of all sorts and
description....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>A herd of sheep stand packed close together, looking
stupidly into space.... Frighten them,&mdash;and
if one begins to run, frantic with terror, the rest
are sure to follow,&mdash;a stampede ensues, each sheep
scrupulously reproduces the identical movements of
the one in front of it. This susceptibility to imitation
is but what we, in relation to man, term suggestibility,
which consists in the impressing on the
person of an idea, image, movement, however absurd
and senseless, which the person in his hypnotized
state reproduces like an automaton,&mdash;although he
or she thinks it is done quite voluntarily. Suggestibility
is natural to man as a social animal. Under
specially favorable conditions this suggestibility
which is always present in human beings may increase
to an extraordinary degree, and the result is
a stampede, a mob, an epidemic.</p>

<p>It is sometimes claimed that somnambulic persons
are asleep. Sleep and somnambulism have
been identified. This is a misuse of words since there
are a whole series of subconscious states in which
not one symptom of sleep appears. <em>Extreme susceptibility
to suggestions and mental automatisms
are the chief traits of the subconscious.</em></p>

<p>Gregarious men and women carry within themselves
the germs of the possible mob, or of mental
epidemics. As social creatures men and women are
naturally suggestible. When this susceptibility or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
sensitivity to suggestions becomes abnormally intense,
we may say that they are thrown into a social
subconscious, somnambulic state.</p>

<p>We know by psychological and psychopathological
experiments that limitation of voluntary movements
and inhibition of free activities induce a subconscious
state. This subconscious state is characterized
by inhibition of the will power,&mdash;memory
remains unaffected; consciousness appears intact;
the subject is aware of all that goes on.</p>

<p>Keeping this in mind, we can understand social
life, and especially morbid, social movements, mob
life of all ages.</p>

<p>A subconscious state is induced in the organized
individual by the great limitation of his voluntary
activities and by the inhibition of his free critical
thought. Bound fast by the strings of tradition and
authority, social men and women are reduced to subconscious
automata. The subconscious rises with
the growth of organized civilization, while the critical,
independent powers of the individual correspondingly
fall. Hence the apparent social paradox that
the growth of society tends to destroy the mental
forces which helped to build up civilization.</p>

<p>In such societies the individual staggers under
the burden of laws and taboos. Individuality is
stifled under the endless massive excretions of legislators.
Recently even the lawgivers or law manufacturers
began to object to the labor involved in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
the work on the ever growing mass of bills introduced
into the legislature of one state alone. Thus
a senator of a Western state complained that in
<em>one</em> year over 1700 bills passed through the mill
of his Legislature. Multiply that figure by the
number of states, add the municipal edicts, and the
endless laws turned out by the Federal Government,
and one can form some faint idea of the vast burden
laid on the shoulders of the individual citizen.</p>

<p>The Los Angeles Times, which no one will accuse
of radicalism, pointedly remarks: “The State has
just issued a reference index to the laws of California
since 1850&mdash;it is of itself a bulky volume of
more than 1300 pages. When it takes a book of
that size merely as an <em>index</em> it would seem that the
lawmakers had about done their worst.”</p>

<p>Over-production of laws is one of the great evils
of modern civilization. Civilized society is apt to be
obsessed by a state of law-mania which is a danger
and a menace to the free development of the individual
citizen.</p>

<p>The Roman legal thinkers left us two significant
sayings: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ex Senatus consultis et plebiscitis, crimina
execrentur</i>,&mdash;(Senatorial decisions and popular
decrees give rise to crimes) and: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ut olim vitiis, sic
nunc legibus laboramus</i>,&mdash;(As we formerly suffered
from vices and crimes so we suffer at present from
laws and legislation)....</p>

<p>In describing the gregariousness of the Damara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
oxen Francis Galton writes: “Although the ox has
so little affection for, or interest in, his fellows, he
cannot endure even a momentary severance from his
herd. If he be separated from it by stratagem or
force, he exhibits every sign of mental agony; he
strives with all his might to get back again, and
when he succeeds, he plunges into the middle to bathe
his whole body with the comfort of closest companionship.
This passionate terror is a convenience to
the herdsman.” ... When an animal accustomed
to a gregarious life is isolated from the herd, it is
agitated with extreme terror. The same holds true
of man who is a social animal. Man must go with
the herd or with the pack, and he is terrified to stand
alone, away from the crowd,&mdash;and still more terrorized
when the crowd disapproves of him. Man is
gregarious, and as such he must go with the mass,
with the crowd. He is in mortal fear of social
taboo. As a gregarious animal man lives in fear
of external danger, and is in terror of social authority.</p>

<p>As Galton writes: “The vast majority of persons
of our race have a natural tendency to shrink
from the responsibility of standing and acting alone:
they exalt the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox populi</i>, even when they know it to
be the utterance of a mob of nobodies, into the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vox
Dei</i>; they are willing slaves to tradition, authority
and custom. The intellectual deficiencies corresponding
to these moral flaws are shown by the rareness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
of free and original thought as compared with
the frequency and readiness with which men accept
the opinions of those in authority as binding on their
judgment.” This slavish obedience is intimately
bound up with one of the most fundamental of all
instincts,&mdash;the fear instinct.</p>

<p>The individual is so effectively trained by the
pressure of taboo based on self and fear, that he
comes to love the yoke that weighs him down to
earth. Chained to his bench like a criminal galley
slave, he comes to love his gyves and manacles. The
iron collar put around his neck becomes a mark of
respectability, an ornament of civilization. Tarde
finds that society is based on respect, a sort of an
alloy of fear and love, fear that is loved. A respectable
citizen is he who is fond of his bonds, stocks,
and shekels, and comes to love his bonds, stocks, and
shackles of <em>fears and taboos</em>.</p>

<p>Human institutions depend for their existence and
stability on the impulse of self-preservation and its
close associate,&mdash;the fear instinct.</p>

<br />
MYSTICISM, PRAYER, CONVERSION, AND METAPHYSICS</h2>


<p>The psychology of mysticism and conversion is
a fascinating subject. This is not the place to go
into detail or even adequately cover the subject
which is as extensive as it is important. I can only
touch the matter in a superficial way&mdash;enough to
answer the present purpose.</p>

<p>The state of mysticism is essentially a hypnoidal
trance state, and its traits are the characteristics of
the hypnoidal consciousness. Like the hypnoidal
state, that of the mystic state may pass into waking,
sleep, or into the hypnotic condition.</p>

<p>James marks off mystic states, by the traits of
Ineffability, Transciency, Passivity, and Noetic
Quality. These traits are just the ones found in the
deeper states of the hypnoidal consciousness, especially
the ones which approximate and pass into the
hypnotic condition. In the mystical state, as in
the hypnoidal state, there is a delicious languor, a
lack of tension to the stimulation of the external environment
which retreats in the distance; there is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the instability of the hypnoidal consciousness which
soon passes into the other forms such as sleep, hypnosis,
or waking. There is also present the refreshing,
invigorating condition of the whole individuality
on emerging from those peculiar subconscious states.
The lethargic and cataleptic states often present in
states of ecstasy, in which the mystics fall, depend
entirely on states of the hypnoido-hypnotic trance.</p>

<p>The mystic consciousness and the hypnoidal one
are not identical. The mystic consciousness is a
species of the hypnoidal consciousness. What are
then its special features? In the first place, the
mystic consciousness has a negative and a positive
aspect, depression and exaltation. In the second
place, mysticism expresses a definite reaction of the
individual to the conditions of his external environment.
This reaction is one of retraction from the
miseries and fears of life.</p>

<p>If we examine closely the type of consciousness
characteristic of the state preceding the onset of
the mystic condition, we find that it is essentially
that of suffering, of misery, of disappointment, of
despair, of inability to meet fairly, squarely, and
courageously the experiences of life. There is a
strong feeling of insecurity, a feeling of anxiety as
to self and the world. A feeling of intense anguish
seizes on the individual that he and the world are
going to perdition, that on such terms life is not
worth living. The instinct of fear penetrates every<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
pore of his being, and inspires the individual with
dread, horror, and terror. Terrorized by the wild
evils of life, the personality becomes benumbed and
paralyzed, and ready to succumb. This state of
intense depression is not simply related to fear, <em>it is
fear</em>. It is the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">status melancholicus</i> often preceding
states of exaltation. The individual reaches a critical
condition where life becomes impossible. The
whole universe holds for him nothing but terrors
and horrors.</p>

<p>Carlyle expresses this attitude when he makes
Teufeldroeckh say: “I live in a continual, indefinite,
pining fear; tremulous, pusillanimous, apprehensive
of I know not what: it seems as if things, all things
in the heavens above and the earth beneath would
hurt me; as if the heavens and the earth were but
boundless jaws of a devouring monster, wherein I,
palpitating, lie waiting to be devoured.”</p>

<p>In this state of agony of fear, the individual looks
for salvation in fleeing from the terrors of the world
to the arms of the divinity.</p>

<p>In his terror the individual passes through a
second stage, he becomes “converted,” he turns with
prayers to the divine power to which he looks for
shelter from the dangers of life. He appeals to the
divinity for protection from the evils of the day and
from the terrors of the night. This second stage
is often preceded by a period of subconscious incubation
which sometimes gives rise to sudden conscious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
explosions, conscious conversions, or sudden
onset of mystic state of ecstasy.</p>

<p>In the library of Ashburbanipal, king of Assyria,
there are found “penitential psalms” much alike to
our own, but some millenniums older than the Biblical
psalms. These Assyro-Babylonian penitential
psalms, inscribed in cuneiform script on clay tablets,
clearly express the attitude of the worshipper or
suppliant:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry pad1">
<p class="verseq">“O Goddess, in the anguish of my heart have I raised cries of anguish to thee; declare forgiveness.</p>
<p class="verse">May thy heart be at rest.</p>
<p class="verse">May thy liver be pacified.</p>
<p class="verse">The sin which I have committed I know not.</p>
<p class="verse">The Lord in the anger of his heart hath looked upon me.</p>
<p class="verse">The goddess hath become angry and hath stricken me grievously.</p>
<p class="verse">I sought for help, but no one taketh my hand.</p>
<p class="verse">I wept, but no one cometh to my side.</p>
<p class="verse">I utter cries, but no one harkens to me.</p>
<p class="verse">I am afflicted, I am overcome.</p>
<p class="verse">Unto my merciful god I turn.</p>
<p class="verse">I kiss the feet of my goddess.</p>

<p class="verse">They do not know whether they do good or evil.</p>

<p class="verse">He is cast into the mire; take his hand.</p>
<p class="verse">The sin which I have sinned turn to mercy!</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
<p class="verse">Known and unknown goddess, my sins are seven times seven;</p>
<p class="verse">Forgive my sins!</p>
<p class="verse">Forgive my sins, and I will humble myself before thee.</p>
<p class="verse">May thy heart, as the heart of a mother who hath borne children, be glad!</p>
<p class="verse">As a father who hath begotten them, may it be glad!”</p>
</div></div>

<p>In this respect we agree with Ribot. “Depression,”
says Ribot, “is related to fear.... Does
not the worshipper entering a venerated sanctuary
show all the symptoms of pallor, trembling, cold
sweat, inability to speak&mdash;all that the ancients so
justly called <em>sacer</em> horror? The self abasement, the
humility of the worshipper before the deity supposed
to be possessed of magic power, is essentially one
of fear.” With the anthropologist we may refer this
awe or fear to the terror which the savage mind
feels in the presence of the magician, the witch, the
medicine man, the man-god, and the woman-deity.</p>

<p>The Mithraic religion, which for some time has
been the great rival of Christianity for the salvation
of the individual from the terrors of the world,
played a great rôle in the mystic ceremonies of
the cult. In fact, the dying and the resurrection
of a god-man for the salvation of the worshippers
constituted a cardinal principle in the actual practices
or rites of barbarous nations and savage tribes.
The man-god or woman-deity had to die, had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
sacrificed by the community. The sins of the savages
were redeemed by the divine flesh and blood of “the
man-god.”</p>

<p>In describing the life and theological doctrines
of St. Paul, Professor Pfleiderer says: “Perhaps
Paul was influenced by the popular idea of the god
who dies and returns to life, dominant at that time
in the Adonis, Attis, and Osiris cults of Hither Asia
(with various names and customs, everywhere much
alike). At Antioch, the Syrian capital, in which
Paul had been active for a considerable period, the
main celebration of the Adonis feast took place in
the spring time. On the first day, the death of
‘Adonis,’ the Lord, was celebrated, while on the
following day, amid the wild songs of lamentations
sung by the women, the burial of his corpse (represented
by an image) was enacted. On the next day
(in the Osiris celebration it was the third day after
death, while in the Attis celebration it was the
fourth day) proclamation was made that the god
lived and he (his image) was made to rise in the
air. It is noteworthy that the Greek Church has
preserved a similar ceremony in its Easter celebration
down to our own day.</p>

<p>“During the joyous feast of the resurrection of
the god in the closely related Attis celebration, the
priest anointed the mouths of the mourners with oil,
and repeated the formula:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
<p class="verseq">‘Good cheer, ye pious! As our god is saved,</p>
<p class="verse">So shall we, too, be saved in our distress.’</p>
</div></div>

<p>“The rescue of the god from death is the guarantee
of a like rescue for the adherents of his cult.
In the mysteries of Attis, Isis, and Mithra, the fact
that the worshippers partook of the god’s life by the
mystical participation in his death, was visualized
by such rites, which employed symbols showing the
death of the initiate, his descent into Hades, and his
return. Hence, this ceremony was called the ‘re-birth
to a career of new salvation,’ a ‘holy birthday.’
In one Mithra liturgy, the newly initiated
pray: ‘Lord, reborn, I depart; in that I am lifted
up, I die; born by that birth which produces life, I
will be saved in death, and go the way which thou
hast established, according to thy law and the sacrament
which thou hast created.’”</p>

<p>In all those mysteries the central note is the salvation
of the worshipper from the “perils of the
soul.”</p>

<p>In some cases the terrorized individual is driven
to the mystic state. He falls into a sort of trance.
The world of fears becomes veiled from him, and
recedes in a mist, and even completely disappears
from his view. He finds repose in his god. This is
the positive stage of mental exaltation, of ecstasy;
it figures as “the union” of the worshipper with his
god or goddess. It is this oblivion in the depths of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
the hypnoidal and the hypnotic states, it is this relapse
into the regions of the subconscious that
brings about relief from all fears of life. The bliss
felt in these dim regions of mental life refreshes and
invigorates the wearied soul. The coming in contact
with new vast stores of subconscious reserve
energy may once more vitalize and supply with new
energy the fear stricken personality. This is the
inspiration of those who have experienced the mystical
power of “conversion.”</p>

<p>In a later chapter I take up the subject of subconscious
reserve energy advanced by James and
myself, independently. Meanwhile, we may say that
the phenomena of prayer, conversion, and especially
of mysticism belong fundamentally to the manifestations
of self-preservation and the fear instinct on
the one side and to subconscious reserve energy on
the other.</p>

<p>Of course, we must add the fact that certain historical
and social conditions are apt to give rise to
phenomena of mysticism, the conditions of social
unrest being especially favorable. When social life
begins to decay, when the protection of society is
weakened, and the individual is set loose, and left to
stand alone, something that especially terrorizes the
social brute, then nothing is left to the individual
bereft of his social stays and social stimulants, but
to turn <em>inward</em> and <em>upward</em>, that is to turn mystic.
In his states of desolation and fear-obsession the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
individual is inclined to turn to the stimulating, narcotizing
influence of the deity which puts the soul in
a state of transcendental bliss, thus hiding the terrorized
soul in a misty and mystic cloud, so that he no
longer sees the terrors and horrors of life.</p>

<p>Such mystic states are found in periods of social
and moral decay. Instance the decaying Roman
empire, the Hellenistic period, the Middle Ages, and
in fact, any period in which security, safety, and
social stability are on the ebb, while fears and perils
are on the increase. Mysticism, Salvation of the
soul, under all their guises, are interrelated with
the primordial fear instinct which dominates the
hunted beast and the terror-stricken neurotic patient.</p>

<p>If we turn to philosophical and metaphysical
speculations, we find, on examination from a pragmatic
point of view, that their essential differences
revolve on the <em>security and safety of the world
scheme</em>. From Plato and Aristotle to Seneca, Epictetus,
Marcus Aurelius, down to Schopenhauer,
Hegel, and our American thinkers Royce and James,
as well as from the Bible to Brahmanism and Buddhism,
we find the same valuation of world safety,
based on the vital impulse of self-preservation and
its fundamental fear instinct. The <em>Salvation</em> of the
World and the Individual is the fundamental keynote
of theological metaphysics and metaphysical
religion.</p>

<p>Professor Royce, the representative of transcendental,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
monistic idealism in America, thus summarizes
his philosophical and religious attitude: “It
is God’s true and eternal triumph that speaks to
us ‘In this world ye shall have tribulations. But
fear not; I have overcome the world.’” This reminds
one of the ancient Assyrian cuneiform oracles
addressed to the Assyrian kings: “To Esarhaddon,
king of countries, Fear not! I am Ishtar of Arbela.
Thine enemies I will cut off, fear not!” “Fear not,
Esarhaddon, I, Bel, am speaking with thee. The
beams of thy heart I will support.” “Fear not, you
are saved by Faith. Fear thy Lord only, He is
your Rock and Salvation,” says the Bible. “Fear
not!” teaches the Buddhist, “Nirvana, the Absolute,
is your refuge.”</p>

<p>Professor James in his inimitable way summarizes
the difference between his pluralism and idealistic
monism: “What do believers in the Absolute mean
by saying that their belief affords them comfort?
They mean that since in the Absolute finite evil is
‘overruled’ already, we may, therefore, whenever we
wish, treat the temporal as if it were potentially the
eternal, be sure that we can trust its outcome, and,
without sin, dismiss our fear and drop the worry of
our finite responsibility.... The universe is a
system of which the individual members may relax
their anxieties....” James contrasts his empirical,
pragmatic pluralism with the idealistic monism.</p>

<p>In another place James says: “Suppose that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
world’s author put the case before you before creating,
saying: ‘I am going to make a world not
certain to be saved, a world, the perfections of which
shall be conditioned merely, the condition being that
each several agent “does his level best.” I offer you
the chance of taking part in such a world. Its
safety, you see, is unwarranted. It is a real adventure,
with real danger, yet it may win through....
Will you join the procession? Will you trust yourself
and trust the other agents enough to face the
risk?’ Should you in all seriousness, if participation
in such a world were proposed to you, feel bound to
reject it as not safe enough? Would you say that
rather than be part and parcel of so fundamentally
pluralistic and irrational a universe, you preferred
to relapse into the slumber of nonentity from which
you had been aroused by the tempter’s voice?</p>

<p>“Of course, if you are normally constituted, you
would do nothing of the sort. There is a healthy-minded
buoyancy in most of us which such a universe
would exactly fit.... The world proposed
would seem ‘rational’ to us in the most living way.</p>

<p>“Most of us, I say, would, therefore, welcome the
proposition, and add our <em>fiat</em> to the <em>fiat</em> of the creator.
Yet perhaps some would not; for there are
morbid minds in every human collection, and to them
the prospect of a universe with only a fighting
chance of safety would probably not appeal. There
are moments of discouragement in us all, when we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
are sick of self, and tired of vainly striving. Our
own life breaks down, and we fall into the attitude
of the prodigal son. We mistrust the chance of
things. We want a universe where we can just give
up, fall on our father’s neck, and be absorbed into the
absolute life as a drop of water melts into the river
or the sea.</p>

<p>“The peace and rest, the security desiderated at
such moments is security against the bewildering
accidents of so much finite experience.</p>

<p>“Nirvana means safety from this everlasting
round of adventure of which the world of sense consists.
The Hindoo and the Buddhist, for this is
essentially their attitude, are simply <em>afraid, afraid</em>
(my italics) of more experience, afraid of life....</p>

<p>“Pluralistic moralism simply makes their teeth
chatter, it refrigerates the very heart within their
breast.”</p>

<p>Thus we find that at the bottom of philosophical,
metaphysical, and religious speculations there are
present the same primitive impulse of self-preservation
and fear instinct.</p>

<p>While there are some other important factors in
that theological and metaphysical problem which
has agitated humanity for ages, a problem which I
expect to discuss some other time in another place,
there is no doubt that James with his great psychological
genius has laid his finger on fundamental
factors of human life,&mdash;self-preservation and the
fear instinct.</p>

<br />
FEAR SUGGESTIONS</h2>


<p>In my psychopathological and clinical work of
the various manifestations and symptoms of psychopathic
and functional diseases I come to the conclusion
that the principal cause of all those morbid
affections is the fear instinct, rooted in the very impulse
of life, the impulse of self preservation. Fears
are not secondary effects, they are due to one of
the most fundamental of all instincts, the instinct
of fear which is primary and elemental.</p>

<p>Anything which arouses the fear instinct in the
inhibitory or paralyzing stages will necessarily give
rise to psychopathic functional psychosis or neurosis.
The fear instinct and the impulse of self-preservation,
inherent in all life, are the alpha and
omega of psychopathic maladies.</p>

<p>The fear instinct is usually cultivated by a long
history of events of a fearsome character so that
fear instinct and the impulse of self-preservation
become easily aroused on various occasions of
external stimulation, producing general fear,
mental or emotional, and often accompanied by sensory,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
motor, and intestinal derangements of various
organs with their secretions and hormones, as well
as with general morbid, functional changes of the
central nervous system, sympathetic and parasympathetic
systems. This in its turn gradually cultivates
a disposition to formation of hypnoidal states, that
is, the brief momentary formation of trance states,
in which the subconscious becomes through dissociation
exposed to fear suggestions or fear stimulations,
which arouse in the morbidly cultivated subconscious
morbid fear symptoms, motor, sensory,
intestinal, emotional in their various combinations
and associations.</p>

<p><em>The cultivated predisposition to lapses into hypnoidal
states is a prerequisite of psychopathic disturbances.
We may, therefore, say that the three
factors, namely, Self-preservation, Fear instinct,
Hypnoidal states form the triumvirate of psychopathic,
functional neurosis.</em></p>

<p>Charcot with his sharp eye for observation as
well as his long clinical experience observed, in what
he termed hystericals, a brooding period which precedes
the manifestations of the hysterical attacks
and symptom complex of the hysterical manifestations.
These brooding periods are of the utmost
consequence, although Charcot and his disciples as
well as the psychopathologists generally, hardly
paid any attention to this important phenomenon.</p>

<p>These brooding periods preceding the onset of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
malady afterwards recur regularly before each
attack of the malady, only the period is brief, and
is hardly noticeable except by the one who looks
searchingly. Psychopathologists pass this important
stage without noticing its full significance. <em>The
period appears as a sort of a psychic aura, a sort of</em>
momentary attack of epileptic <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">petit mal</i>. This
brooding state is a modification of the hypnoidal
state.</p>

<p>It is during such hypnoidal states, when the conditions
which I have shown to be requisite for the
induction of trance or subconscious states, happen
to be specially strong and the hypnoidal state is prolonged,
that the unprotected subconscious becomes
subject to fear suggestions or to stimuli arousing
the fear instinct and the impulse of self-preservation.</p>

<p>“Many patients,” says the famous physiologist
and physician, Mosso, “die in the hospital from fear
and depression who would probably have recovered
had they been tended in their own homes.... In
their morning round the physicians find that the
serious cases have grown worse, while those who are
better beg to be dismissed.... The physician,
who has the night watch must walk up and down
the whole night, and is kept busy preventing convulsive
attacks, or fainting fits.</p>

<p>“Fear attacks nullify every effort of the will....
Even Alexander of Macedon had to count
with fear in his courageous army of select Macedonians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
In order to insure victory he offered sacrifices
to Fear before he joined battle.”</p>

<p>Physical maladies become worse during the night,
and especially during the early morning hours when
the energy of the body is at its lowest level,&mdash;conscious
and subconscious fears reaching their highest
intensity. This holds specially true of nervous
cases, and particularly of psychopathic patients,
who are dominated by the impulse of self-preservation
and the fear instinct. The fears and worries
keep the patient awake, and the subconscious fears
become emphasized by concentration of attention,
monotony, limitation of field of consciousness, limitation
of voluntary movements, and other factors
favorable to dissociation and the induction of the
hypnoidal state, in which the patient becomes sensitive
to the awakening of the fear instinct, with all
its horrible fear suggestions.</p>

<p>The symptoms of the disease which are more or
less under his control during the day become often
so intensified in the dark, that the patients become
demoralized with fear, suffering as they do the
anxiety and anguish induced by the terrors of the
night. Even medical men, professors of medical
colleges, who have come under my care, have confessed
to me that, when in a state of insomnia, the
terrors of the night are so intense that they had
to resort to morphine to still the anguish of the fear
instinct.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>

<p>For years I lived in close relation with neurotic,
psychopathic patients. I watched them day and
night. I have been called by patients for medical
aid in the late hours of the night, and more so during
the vigil hours of the darkness of the night. I
had to relieve and soothe the fears, the terrors of
the night. It is in the night, when in a low state of
neuron energy that patients feel the grip of horrors
oppressing them with nightmares of the relentless
and merciless instinct, the fear instinct. To be relieved
of the night terrors many patients are willing
to risk anything, even the consequence of deadly
narcotics, the plagues of mental healers, and the
sexual phantasms of Psychoanalysis.</p>

<p>The hypnoidal state is induced artificially, often
brought about by intoxication, as in the case of
holy Soma drink among the Hindoos, or by fasting,
as among the American Indians during the initiation
periods, or by dancing, such as the corrobboree
among the aborigines of Australia, or by singing, or
by praying. All the conditions of disjunction of
consciousness with the manifestations of subconscious
activities are brought into play, in order to
come in contact with demons, spirits, totems, and
find among them guides and protectors.</p>

<p>In prolonged hypnoidal states, the fear instinct
and the impulse of self-preservation are calmed
under appropriate conditions. Illusions and hallucinations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
which easily appeared in the twilight states
of hypnoidal subconscious states became manifested
as beneficent spirits, as agents favorable to the life
existence of the individual, the spirit appearing as
the totem, the guardian of the individual. Prayer
and singing, which are the most successful of all the
methods of inducing subconscious subwaking, twilight
states, have survived to our present day.</p>

<p>Of all the methods of utilization of subconscious
subwaking, twilight states the most effective is
prayer, especially, the individual form of prayer.
Prayer admirably fulfills the conditions requisite for
the induction of the hypnoidal state and for the getting
access to the subconscious activities, the formation
of subconscious personalities, subconscious illusions
and hallucinations. Such subconscious states
have been shown, on experimental evidence, to be not
of a sensory, but of a purely delusional character,
strong enough to affect the individual with an intense
belief in its external reality.</p>

<p>The deluded human mind in its craven fear of the
unseen and the mysterious spirit-forces helps itself
to any soporific or anaesthetic, narcotic stimulant,
to bring about a scission of the conscious self from
the subconscious activities. The induction of the
hypnoidal state is brought about by all kinds of intoxicants,
narcotics, fasting, dancing, self-mortification,
sex excesses which exhaust the devotee, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
leave him in a state of trance. All such practices
and rites seek blindly for some trance-state to still
the morbid fear instinct.</p>

<p>The psychoanalysis of Freud, Jung, Adler,
Stoekel, with their sexual love, belongs to this category
of <em>narcotic sexual religions</em> which inhibit the
critical self.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> The popular novelists try to disclose “the secrets of the
heart” by means of Freudian sex phantasies, psychoanalytic
mother complexes, and Jungian mystic sex libido. It is only in
an era of philistinism and vulgarity with a literature of decadence
and commonplace mediocrity that psychoanalysis can
take root and flourish.</p>

<p><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Die Theorie behauptet mit ausschliessender Sicherheit (?),
das es nur sexuelle Wünschregungen aus dem Infantilen sein
können, welche in den Entwicklungsperioden der Kindheit die
Verdrängung (Affectverwandlung) erfahren haben, in späteren
Entwicklungsperioden dann einer Erneuerung fähig sind, sei
es in folge der sexuelle Konstitution, die sich ja aus der
ursprünglichen Bisexualität herausbildet, sei es in folge ungünstiger
Einflüsse des sexuellen Lebens, und die somit die
Triebkräfte für alle psychoneurotische Symptombildung ab
geben.” (S. Freud, “Die Traumdeutung,” p. 376, zweite
Auflage 1909.)</span> In other words, slippery and mutable as
Freud’s statements are, he clearly declares in his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">magnum opus</i>
the far-reaching generalization that neurosis is based on infantile
sexual wishes, either due to bisexuality or to unfavorable
influences of sexual life. Suppression of sexual experiences can
be easily observed (by competent observers, of course), in infants
a few months old. If you miss the process of suppression
in the baby, you can easily trace it by means of psychoanalysis
to the early recollections of tender infancy. It is certainly lack
of comprehension that induces Ziehen to dub Freud’s speculations
as Unsinn (nonsense). Freud’s admirers with a metaphysical
proclivity delight over the theory of suppressed wishes.
The wish is fundamental and prior to all mental states. This
piece of metaphysical psychologism is supposed to be based on
clinical experience. If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.
The Freudist manages to ride such horses.</p>

<p>The following speculation of Jung’s well represents the
metaphysico-religious character of psychoanalysis: “By entering
again into the mother’s womb he (Christ) redeems in
death the sin of life of the primitive man, Adam, in order
symbolically through his deed to procure for the innermost
and most hidden meaning of the religious libido its highest
satisfaction and most pronounced expression.... In the Christian
mysteries the resurrected one becomes a supermundane
spirit, and the invisible kingdom of God, with its mysterious
gifts are obtained by his believers through the sacrifice of
himself on his mother. In psychoanalysis the infantile personality
is deprived of its libido fixations in a rational manner.
The libido which is thus set free serves for the building up of
a personality matured and adapted to reality, a personality
that does willingly and without complaint everything required
by necessity. (It is, so to speak, the chief endeavor of the
infantile personality to struggle against all necessities, and to
create coercions for itself where none exist in reality.)” Such
metaphysico-religious lucubrations parade under the term
psychoanalysis.</p>

<p>“Man,” says James, “believes as much as he can,” but the
credulity of the psychoanalyst is limitless. The psychoanalyst
with his allegories, symbolism, sublimation, incest phantasies,
bi-sexuality, sexual suppression, mother complexes, Oedipus
and Electra phantasms, and all the other complex psychoanalytic
instrumentalities is an excellent example of sex obsessed,
delusional dementia praecox. Psychoanalysis is a sort
of sexual mysticism. All mental life is reduced by psychoanalysis
to “creation” or “procreation.”</p></div>

<br />
LIFE ENERGY AND THE NEUROTIC</h2>


<p>The subject of fear may be considered from a
somewhat different point of view, namely from a
purely physiological and biological aspect. The cell
in general, the nerve cell, or neuron, is a reservoir of
energy. In fact the great biologist Sachs proposed
to term the cell, <em>energid</em>.</p>

<p>For we must look at the organism as a store of
energy which is used up in the course of the adjustments
of the individual to his environment. The
organism stores up energy and uses the energy during
the course of its life activity.</p>

<p>Life energy is physiological, bio-chemical, electrical,
mechanical, etc. The mental and emotional
activities are intimately related with the expenditure
of energy accumulated by the cells of the
organism, which discharge that energy in response
to the various stimulations of the external world.
In its activities the organism keeps on taking in
energy, and once more discharging energy in its life
reactions. The storing up of energy falls under the
anabolic or building up processes, while the discharging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
or liberating processes of the amount of the
stored up energy are classed under the katabolic
processes.</p>

<p>The total cycle of energy from the start of storage
to the end of liberation of energy, starting once
more with the storing of energy, may be regarded as
the cycles of organic functional activity which is
classified under metabolism. We deal here with a
reservoir of vital energy whose life activities or
reactions depend on the amount of energy contained
in the cell or the neuron, and whose functioning and
reactions vary with the level of energy in the
reservoir.</p>

<p>The neuron is but a highly differentiated cell or
reservoir for the intake and outgo of energy. In
this respect the nerve cell is entirely like other cells
of humbler function. Every cell is a storage cell,
accumulating energy and then liberating it at an
appropriate occasion of a given stimulus, all cells
working for the preservation of the organism as a
whole. The rise and fall of the level of energy in the
reservoir regulate the various manifestations, sensory,
motor, emotional, mental which the individual
displays to the various stimulations coming from his
environment.</p>

<p>Within certain limits the fall of energy is normal,&mdash;when
it reaches a certain level the organism once
more replenishes the store and once more the level of
energy rises. This energy is <em>Dynamic</em> under certain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
conditions. However, the discharge of energy must
go on, and the organism must draw further on its
store of energy, on the accumulated store of energy
put away for safety and emergency. This stored
up energy is <em>Reserve Energy</em>.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<p>The late Charles S. Minot, the American histologist,
points out this reserve energy present in the
organism, a reserve energy of growth called forth
under special emergencies of life.</p>

<p>By a striking series of instructive facts, Dr.
Meltzer points out that “all organs of the body are
built on the plan of superabundance of structure
and energy.” Like Minot, Meltzer refers to the
significant fact that most of our active organs
possess a great surplus of functioning cells. This
surplus is requisite for the safety of the individual.</p>

<p>If, however, the drain of energy still goes on without
replenishing the total store, the energy drawn
on the region of the danger zone is entered. <em>This
energy is Static.</em> The concomitant symptoms are
various psychomotor and psycho-secretory disturbances
of a psychopathic or psycho-neurotic character.
This energy is drawn from the upper levels
of energy. Under such conditions restitution of the
total amount of energy to its normal level is still
possible.</p>

<p>Should the process of liberation of energy go on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
further without restitution, the energy drawn is
taken from the lower levels of static energy, and the
symptoms are <em>functional</em>, <em>neuropathic</em>. The lower-most
levels of static energy are the last the cell can
dispense with to save itself from total destruction.
With further increase of discharge of energy the
cell must give its very life activity, the energy is
drawn from the breaking up of cell tissue; this
energy is organic or necrotic.</p>

<p>Thus the total energy of the nerve cell or the
neuron may be divided into normal dynamic energy,
reserve energy, static energy, and organic or necrotic
energy. The various nervous and mental diseases
may thus be correlated with the flow and ebb of
neuron energy, with the physiological and pathological
processes that take place in the neuron in
the course of its activity and reactions to the stimuli
of the external and internal environment.</p>

<p>The various levels of neuron energy may be represented
by the diagram on <a href="#DIAG_4">page 336.</a></p>

<p>Static energy is indicated by the diagram NWFI.
By <em>organic energy</em> is meant that energy contained
in the very structure of the tissues of the neuron,
not as yet decomposed into their inorganic constituents.
This is indicated by diagram IFGH.</p>

<p>These phases of neuron energy are not different
kinds of energy, in the sense of being distinct entities;
they merely represent progressive phases or
stages of the same process of neuron activity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Liberation</em> of neuron energy is correlative with
active psychic and physical manifestations. Hence
states of the nervous system corresponding to liberations
of energy are designated as <em>waking states</em>.
<em>Restitution</em> of expended energy or arrest of liberation
of neuron energy goes hand in hand with <em>passive</em>
conditions of the nervous system; hence states of
restitution or arrest of energy are termed collectively
<em>sleeping states</em>.</p>

<p>The ascending arrow, indicating the process of
restitution of energy, corresponds to the ascending
arrow on the right, indicating the parallel psychomotor
sleeping states. The descending arrows indicate
physiological and pathological processes of
liberation of energy, and also their concomitant
psychomotor waking states.</p>

<p>“Ascending” and “descending” mean the rise and
fall of the amount of neuron energy, taking the
upper level of dynamic energy as the starting point.
Briefly stated, <em>descent</em> means <em>liberation</em> of energy
with its concomitant, psychomotor, waking states.
<em>Ascent</em> means <em>restitution</em> of energy with its parallel
sleeping states.</p>

<p>The cycles in dynamic energy correspond to the
physiological manifestations of the nervous system
in the activity and rest of the individual in normal
daily life. Concomitant with the expenditure of
dynamic energy of the neurons, the individual passes
through the active normal waking state, and hand
in hand with the restitution of this expended energy,
he passes through the sleeping states of normal daily
life.</p>

<p>When, however, in the expenditure of energy, the
border line or margin is crossed, dynamic and reserve
energies are used up. In crossing KA the ordinary
normal energies of everyday life are exhausted, and
reserve energy has to be drawn upon. If this reserve
energy is not accessible, the static energy is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
used, or in case the reserve energy is exhausted, then
once more the static energy has to be drawn upon;
in either case the individual enters the domain of the
abnormal, of the pathological.</p>

<p>When the upper levels of static energy are used,
the symptoms are of a psychopathic or neurotic
character. When the use of energy reaches the
lower levels of static energy, affecting the very nutrition
of the neuron, neuropathic manifestations are
the result. When the neuron itself is affected, that
is the organic structure is being dissolved, then
organopathies result. It means the death of the
nerve cell.</p>

DYNAMIC ENERGY</h2>


<p>Whenever the dynamic energy is exhausted and
the levels of reserve energy are reached, the individual
affected begins to feel restless, and if there is
no access to the levels of reserve energy, the individual
gets scared. The fear instinct becomes awakened,
giving rise, after repeated unavailing attempts,
to the states of psychopathic neurosis. In states of
depression, such as hypochondria and more especially
in states of melancholia, the fear instinct is
potent. The fear instinct is brought about in the
darkness of the night, when the individual is fatigued
from his day’s labor, when the external stimuli are
at a minimum, and reserve energy is not available.
The fear instinct rises from the subconscious regions
to the surface of conscious activities.</p>

<p>Convalescent states as well as exhaustion from
pain and disease, such as fever or a shock from some
accident, war-shock, shell-shock, surgical shock predispose
to the manifestation of the fear instinct.
Hence the caution of surgeons in the preparation of
the patient for a serious operation. For the result<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
may be a shock to the system due to the subconscious
activities of the fear instinct present in subconscious
mental life, no longer protected by the
guardianship of the upper consciousness. And it
may also be shown, both by experiment and observation,
that during the subconscious states when the
lower strata of dynamic energy are reached, such as
hypnoidal, hypnoid states, and sleep, that the individual
is more subject to fear than during the waking
states. We know how a sudden noise, a flash of
light during drowsy states or sleep startles one, and
the same holds true of any stimulus. I have observed
the same condition of fright during hypnoidal
states.</p>

<p>We must agree with the French psychologist,
Ribot, when he comes to the conclusion that “every
lowering of vitality, whether permanent or temporary,
predisposes to fear; the physiological conditions
which engender or accompany it, are all
ready; <em>in a weakened organism fear is always in a
nascent condition</em>.”</p>

<p>The fear instinct becomes morbid when the individual
has to draw on his reserve energy, and finds
he is unable to do it. The cure consists in the
release of the reserve energy which has become inaccessible.
This can be done by various methods, but
the best is the method of induction of the hypnoidal
state under the control of a competent psychopathologist.
The whole process consists in the restitution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
of the levels of dynamic energy and the building
up of the patient’s active personality.</p>

<p>From our point of view, fear is not necessarily
due to pain previously experienced, it may be purely
instinctive. The fear instinct may be aroused
<em>directly</em>, such for instance is the fear of young children
who have never before experienced a fall. In
fact we claim that the fear instinct and the restlessness
which expresses it antedate and precede
pain. The fear of pain is but one of the forms
under which the fear instinct is manifested. The
fear instinct appears long before pain and pleasure
come into existence. This holds true not only of
the lower animal life, but also of the vague fear
found in many a case of neurasthenia and functional
neurosis and psychosis. Ribot also calls attention
to pantophobia. “This is a state in which the
patient fears everything, where anxiety instead of
being riveted on one object, floats as a dream, and
only becomes fixed for an instant at a time, passing
from one object to another, as circumstances may
determine.”</p>

<p>It is probably best to classify fears as <em>antecedent</em>
and <em>subsequent</em> to experience, or fears as <em>undifferentiated</em>
and <em>differentiated</em>.</p>

<p>When the dynamic energy is used up in the course
of life adaptations, and reserve energy is drawn
upon, there may be danger that the energy may be
used up until the static energy is reached, and neuropathic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
conditions are manifested. These conditions
are preceded by psychopathic disturbances. Associative
life becomes disturbed, and emotional reactions
become morbid. There is a degeneration or
reversion to earlier and lower forms of mental activity,
and to lower instinctive life. The primitive
instincts, the impulse of self-preservation and the
fear instinct, come to the foreground, giving rise to
the various forms of psychopathic affections.</p>

<p>This process of degeneration and simplification is
characteristic of all forms of psychopathic conditions,
though it may be more prominent in some
cases than in others. The type of mental life becomes
lowered and there is a reversion, a sort of
atavism, to simpler and more childish experiences,
memories, reactions of earlier and less complex forms
of mental life. I have laid special stress on this feature
of psychopathic reactions in all my works on the
subject. What I emphasize in my present work is
the fact that psychopathic reactions are dominated
by self and fear, which are laid bare by the process
of degeneration.</p>

<p>The patient in psychopathic states is tortured by
his fears, he is obsessed by wishes which are entirely
due to his fear and deranged impulse of self-preservation.</p>

<p>As the static energy is reached, and with lack of
functional energy of the dynamic character, the
energy habitually used in the ordinary relations of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
life, the patient experiences a monotony, a void in
his life activity. He has a feeling of distress, as if
something is haunting him, and possibly something
terrible is going to happen to him or his family. He
may have a feeling of some depression, and may suffer
from a constant unquenchable craving for new
stimulations, run after new impressions and excitements
which pale in a short time on his fagged
mind. He is restless, demanding new amusements
and distractions. He is distracted with fear, conscious
and more often subconscious,&mdash;which he is
unable to dispel or shake off. He seems to stand
over a fearful precipice, and he is often ready to
do anything to avoid this terrible gap in his life.
Life is empty, devoid of all interest; he talks of
ennui and even of suicide; he is of a pessimistic,
gloomy disposition, his state of mind approaching a
state of melancholia. He asks for new sensations,
new pleasures, new enjoyments which soon tire him.
He is in the condition of a leaking barrel which never
can be filled.</p>

<p>Psychopathic individuals are in a state of the
wicked “who are like the ocean which never rests.”
This misery of ever forming wishes and attempting
to assuage the inner suffering, this craving for new
pleasures and excitements, in order to still uneasiness,
distress, and the pangs of the fear instinct with
its gnawing, agonizing anxieties, brings the patient
to a state in which he is ready to drink and use<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
narcotics. The patient seeks ways to relieve his
misery. The patient has used up all his available
dynamic energy, and being unable to reach the stores
of reserve energy looks for a key or stimulant to
release his locked up reserve energies. The patient
is unable to respond to the stimuli of life, so he
attempts then the use of his static energy. This can
only result in producing psychopathic and neuropathic
symptoms.</p>

<p>The patient needs to be lifted out of the misery
of monotony and ennui of life, he needs to be raised
from his low level of vitality, to be saved from the
listlessness into which he has fallen. The low level
of energy makes him feel like a physical, nervous,
and mental bankrupt. This bankruptcy is unbearable
to him. He is in a state of distraction, distracted
with the agony of fear. Something must
be done to free himself from the depression of low
spirits and from the low level of energy which keeps
him in a state devoid of all interest in life, accompanied
by physical, mental and moral fatigue. He
is like a prisoner doomed to a life long term.</p>

<p>This constant craving for stimulation of energy,
this reaction to the anxiety of the morbid fear
instinct is the expression of exhaustion of available
dynamic energy for the purpose of normal life
activity. The patient attempts to draw on his
latent reserve energy. Since this form of energy is
not accessible to the stimulations of common life, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
tries to release the energy by means of artificial
stimulations, be it morphine, alcohol, mysticism,
Freudism, sexual and religious “at-one-ments” or by
other stimuli of exciting character. Unable to release
energy by fair means the patient is driven to
the employment of foul means for the stimulation
of new sources of energy. The psychopathic patient
is driven by fear, by fears of life and death.</p>

<p>The morbid fear instinct in all cases is brought
about by exhaustion of energy, whether sudden or
gradual. Fear is due to exhaustion of lower levels
of dynamic energy and to the inability of liberation
of stored up reserve energy. The more intense this
incapacity of utilization of reserve stores of energy
be, the more intense is the fear. When this condition
is prolonged the psychopathic symptoms become
unendurable.</p>

<p>The experienced, thinking surgeon has learned the
danger of this condition in his operating room.
Thus it is told of Porta, the great surgeon of Pavia,
when his patients died under an operation, he used
to throw his knife and instruments contemptuously
to the ground, and shout in a tone of reproach to the
corpse: “Cowards die of fear.”</p>

<p>The great physiologist Mosso gives a graphic
description of the effects of fear in a pathetic case
that has come under his personal observation: “As
army surgeon, I had once to be present at the execution
of some brigands. It was a summary judgment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
A major of the <em>besaglieri</em> put a few questions
to one or two, then turning to the captain said
simply: ‘Shoot them.’ I remember one lad, of
scarcely twenty years of age, who mumbled replies
to a few questions, then remained silent, in the position
of a man warding off a fatal blow, with lifted
arms, extended palms, the neck drawn between the
shoulders, the head held sideways, the body bent and
drawn backwards. When he heard the dreadful
words he emitted a shrill, heart-rending cry of despair,
looked around him, as though eagerly seeking
something, then turned to flee, and rushed with
outspread arms against a wall of the court, writhing
and scratching it as though trying to force an
entrance between the stones, like a polyp clinging to
a rock. After a few screams and contortions, he
suddenly sank to the ground, powerless and helpless
like a log. He was pale and trembled as I have never
seen anyone tremble since. It seemed as though the
muscles had been turned to a jelly which was shaken
in all directions.”</p>

<br />
FEAR VARIETIES</h2>


<p>The great psychologist Ribot classifies fears into
pain fears, and disgust fears. To quote from Ribot:
“I propose to reduce them (fears) to two groups.
The first is directly connected with fear and includes
all manifestations, implying in any degree
whatever the fear of pain, from that of a fall or the
prick of a needle, to that of illness or death. The
second is directly connected with disgust, and seems
to me to include the forms which have sometimes been
called pseudophobia (Gelineau). Such are the fear
of contact, the horror of blood and of innocuous
animals, and many strange and causeless aversions.
Let us remark furthermore that fear and disgust
have a common basis, being both instruments of protection
or defense. The first is the defensive-conservative
instinct of relative life, the second the
defensive-conservative instinct of organic life. As
both have a common basis of aversion, they show
themselves in equivalent ways: fear of withdrawal,
departure, flight, disgust by vomiting and nausea:
The reflexes of disgust are the succedanea of flight;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
the organism cannot escape by movement in space
from the repugnant object which it has taken into
itself, and goes through a movement of expulsion
instead.”</p>

<p>I hesitate to accept Ribot’s classification, inasmuch
as we have pointed out that fear is prior to
pain. In most lower animals it is hardly probable
that not having representations that there is present
a fear of pain in advance of the pain itself. Fear
under such conditions can only be awakened by an
actual sensory experience whether it be painful or
not. In fact Ribot himself agrees to the fact that
“There is a primary, instinctive, unreasoning fear
preceding all individual experience, a hereditary
fear.”</p>

<p>Perhaps a word may be said in regard to the
factor of disgust as having a common basis with
fear. It is only by a stretch of imagination, if not
by a stretch of words, that fear and disgust can be
identified. There may be fear where there is no disgust,
and there may be disgust where there is no
fear. The two are independent variables, and can
hardly be referred to as one and the same fundamental
reaction, such as withdrawal and flight. The
object of disgust does not preclude approach. The
avoidance or aversion, the nausea and vomiting are
all subsequent phenomena. Disgust may even follow
after an abuse of food, of pleasant or necessary
objects of nutrition, such as satiety.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span></p>

<p>The reactions of the fear instinct run the contrary
way, approach is precluded from the very
start. Fear is not associated with useful objects or
events, unless it be in morbid states of fear.</p>

<p>And still fear and disgust may become intimately
associated when disgust and its objects awaken the
fear instinct, and the fear becomes the fear of disgust
or of the disgusting object. Disgust is more of
a specialized character, and is associated with particular
events or specific objects, while fear, in its
primitive form at least, is more of a generalized
character.</p>

<p>In the higher forms of life disgust may be so intimately
related to fear that the two become synthesized,
so to say, and are felt like one emotional state,
the state becoming one of fear disgust. In such
cases the fear instinct, fear disgust, is a determining
factor of the morbid state. This is confirmed
by clinical experience of the various cases of psychopathic
functional neurosis and psychosis.</p>

<p>In the various morbid states of the depressive
types fear is awakened long before any pain is actually
suffered, or any particular cause is found by the
patient to account for the terror that dominates his
mental life. The fear comes first while the representative
cause is assigned by the sufferer as the
cause of the fear.</p>

<p>Similarly in the functional psychosis and neurosis
the object, experience, event, may be quite ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>
without any suggestion of pain or distress in
it. In fact, the experience may be indifferent or
even pleasant, but when associated with the fear
instinct may become the nucleus of a very distressing
pathological state. The experience is the <em>occasion</em>,
while the fear instinct, the intimate companion of
the impulse of self-preservation, is the only cause
of functional psychopathic maladies.</p>

<p>The fear instinct in its primitive state is anterior
to all experiences of danger, pain, and suffering, as
is the case in most of the lower animals. In the
higher animals where memory is developed, the fear
instinct is associated with some form of representation,
however vague, and then fear becomes posterior
to experience. In man both forms of fear are present.
The anterior form is specially found in children,
while in adults the posterior form is, under normal
conditions, predominating. The primitive anterior
type of the fear instinct is by no means absent, in
fact, it is more overpowering, its effects are overwhelming
when it comes forth from the subconscious
regions to which it is confined, and is manifested
under conditions of lowered vitality.</p>

<p>When the strata of dynamic energies are passed
and the strata of reserve energies are reached, the
reserve energy not being accessible, the fear instinct
is elemental, fundamental, while the fear of pain and
of some definite representation of danger, or of suffering
is a secondary consequence. People may suffer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
from pain, disease, and even danger, and still
have no fear, while others may have never experienced
the pain or disease, and still be obsessed by
intense pangs of fear. Fear is <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sui generis</i>, it is at
the foundation of animal life.</p>

<p>The fear instinct may be awakened directly by a
sensory stimulus, when, for instance, one finds himself
in darkness and feels some creeping, slimy thing,
or when attacked suddenly with a club or a knife.
The fear instinct may again be aroused by an expectation,
by something to which his dynamic energies
cannot respond adequately, while the reserve energies
<ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'are in abeyanace'">are in abeyance</ins>, such for instance as the expectation
of some threatening event either to himself
or to the objects bound up with his life existence.
When one is threatened with some misfortune, with
torture, death, or with a mortal disease, or with a
serious operation, or when confronted with great
danger against which his energies prove inadequate,
in such cases the fear is ideational. These types of
fear may in turn be either conscious or subconscious.</p>

<p>We may thus classify the fears as follows:</p>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" width="80%" summary="">
<tr><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdl"></td><td class="tdl">{ Conscious</td></tr>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span></p>

<p>The fear of the etherized or chloroformed patient
is entirely of the subconscious type. It is the arousing
of subconscious fear which, from the nature of
the case, cannot be reached and alleviated that gives
rise to functional psychosis and neurosis.</p>

<p>From this standpoint it may be said that <em>psychopathic
diseases are subconscious fear states, in other
words functional psychosis or neurosis is essentially
a disease of subconscious activities</em>. This is, in fact,
confirmed by my clinical experience and by my psychopathological
research work.</p>

<p>Dr. L. J. Pollock, professor of nervous diseases
at Northwestern University Medical School, made
an extremely interesting “Analysis of a Number of
Cases of War Neurosis.” This analysis fully conforms
to the results obtained by me in my work on
functional psychosis and neurosis carried on for a
great number of years. It fully confirms the results
of my studies, clinical and psychopathological,
that the causation, or etiology of functional psychopathic
states depends on fluctuations of the levels
of neuron energy, or physical exhaustion, fatigue,
hunger and thirst, or shock to the system, and more
especially on the ravages of the fear instinct,
aroused during the dangers and horrors of war.</p>

<p>“Of several hundred cases which I observed in
base hospitals in France, copies of about 350
records were available. From these 200 of the more
detailed ones were selected to determine the relative<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
frequency of some of the factors.... From the
numerical group has been excluded cases of emotional
instability, timorousness, hospital neuroses
occurring as an aftermath of an illness or a wound,
the phobic reactions of gassed patients and constitutional
neuroses, and those not directly related to
the war.</p>

<p>“Heredity as a factor plays but a small part, and
the incidence of neuropathic taint constituted little
over 4 per cent.</p>

<p>“Of these 43 per cent followed shell fire, 36 per
cent after concussion as described by the soldier....
A definite history of fatigue and hunger was
obtained in 30.5 per cent. Both probably occurred
in a greater percentage, but were frequently masked
by other symptoms which occupied the patient’s attention
to a greater extent. Fatigue and hunger
are important factors, not only because they prepare
the ground for an ensuing neurosis by breaking
down the defensive reactions, but also in that when
the patient is more sensitive and impressionable, the
natural physical consequences of fatigue are misinterpreted
by him as an evidence of an illness, and
give rise to apprehension and fear.</p>

<p>“As frequently as fear is seen in some form or
other in the neuroses of civil life, so does it manifest
itself in the war neuroses. Fifty per cent of the
cases admitted considerable fear under shell fire.
Concussion was the immediate precipitating cause<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
of the neuroses in 31 per cent of the cases. The
symptoms of the neuroses could be divided into those
of the reactions of fear and fatigue.”</p>

<p>These results corroborate my work on neurosis as
due to exhaustion of Neuron Energy and Self-Fear.</p>

<p>In fact, in one of my works written at the beginning
of the war, I predicted the wide occurrence
of what is known as shell shock, war shock or war
neurosis. The prediction was fully corroborated by
the facts.</p>

<p>Fear, Self, Reserve Energy, and Fatigue are the
main factors in the formation of the psychopathic
or neurotic condition. Janet, in a recent article
of his, lays stress on the fear states in psychopathic
affections and refers these conditions to the
levels of vital energy. There is no doubt that Janet
lays his finger on the very heart of the psychopathic
diathesis.</p>

<p>In my work I come to a similar conclusion only
I lay more stress on the fear states, being referred
to the fundamental instinct present in all animal
life as a primordial condition of existence. This
instinct is intensified and extended in the psychopathic
diathesis.</p>

<p>The level of energy and the fear instinct are
vitally interdependent. A low level of energy, especially
a dissociation or inhibition of the store
of reserve energy, arouses an excess of reaction of
the fear instinct, and <em>vice versa</em> the excessive reaction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
of the fear instinct locks up the stores of
reserve energy, thus intensifying and extending the
psychopathic states with their fear-fatigue conditions.
Janet refers indirectly to the impulse of
self-preservation which is of the utmost consequence
in psychopathic affections. On the whole, I may say
that my work and clinical experience are in accord
with that of the great French psychopathologist.</p>

<p>Where the fear instinct, self, and inhibition of reserve
energy are present, then any emotion, even that
of love, and devotion, will give rise to psychopathic
states. This psychopathic state is not produced,
because of the intensity or repression of the emotion,
but because of the underlying subconscious
predisposition to fear-instinct, self-preservation,
and inhibition of reserve energy.</p>

<p>The feelings of inhibited reserve energy produced
by fear and self, make the individual hesitate in
decision, in action, and finally demoralize and terrorize
him. These conditions take away from him all
assurance and security of life and action, and hold
him in a perpetual state of anxiety until he becomes
completely incapacitated for all kinds of action and
reaction.</p>

<p>Events that threaten the impulse of self-preservation
of the individual, such as misfortunes, shocks,
losses, tend to bring about psychopathic states, on
account of the aroused fear instinct, on account of
the impulse of self-preservation, and sudden inhibition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
of the stores of reserve energy. Events that
may lead to dissolution of personality are, hence,
attended with intense anxiety.</p>

<p>As we have seen, an intense state of fear, conscious
or subconscious, produces a state of aboulia, a state
of indecision, a state of incompletion of action, a
state of insufficiency, a paralysis of will power, and
a sense of unreality, all of which are intimately interrelated.
For the fear instinct, when intense, inhibits
and arrests the will and paralyzes action.
<em>The patient fears, not because he is inactive, but he
is inactive, because he fears.</em></p>

<p>The impulse of self-preservation, the fear instinct,
and the principle of subconscious reserve energy give
an insight into the multiform symptomatology of the
psychopathic diathesis.</p>

<p>The following classes of people are subject to psychopathic
affections:</p>

<p><span class="lsp">(I)</span> Childless people.</p>

<p><span class="lsp">(II)</span> People who had been afflicted with various
diseases in childhood.</p>

<p><span class="lsp">(III)</span> Children of sickly, nervous, psychopathic
parents who have kept their progeny in a constant
state of anxiety, full of terrors and troubles of life.</p>

<p><span class="lsp">(IV)</span> People who had been affected by a series
of shocks and fears in childhood and youth.</p>

<p><span class="lsp">(V)</span> People whose parents suffered long from
various systemic diseases, especially cardiac and
tubercular troubles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="lsp">(VI)</span> In a large family of children the first, or last
child, or sickly child of psychopathic parents.</p>

<p><span class="lsp">(VII)</span> The only child, or sickly child, especially
of a widowed parent who is of a psychopathic diathesis.</p>

<p><em>In all these cases the psychopathic state is due to
early cultivation of the fear instinct, self-impulse,
and low level or dissociated state of vital reserve
energy.</em></p>

CONTROL OF THE NEUROTIC<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></h2>


<p>The first thing in the examination and treatment
of neurosis is the elimination of any physical
trouble. It is only after such an elimination that
one should resort to psychotherapeutic treatment.</p>

<p>In psychopathic or neurotic diseases one should
take into consideration the fact that the patients
are characterized by the tendency of formation of
habits which are hard to break. The patients are
apt to ask that the same thing be done again and
again for the simple reason that it has been done
several times before. In other words, <em>psychopathic
neurosis is characterized by automatism and routine</em>.
This tendency to <em>recurrence</em> is characteristic of all
forms of primitive life as well as of mental activities
which are on the decline,&mdash;it is the easiest way to get
along.</p>

<p>Effort is abhorrent to the patient. He is afraid
of change in the same way as the savage is afraid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
of any novelty or of any change in custom. Tradition
is holy, and in a double sense, because it has
been handed down by former generations, regarded
as divine and superior, and because the new is strange
and, therefore, may prove dangerous and of evil
consequence. What has not been tried may prove
harmful, pernicious, and even deadly. The old has
been tried and approved by generations and the consequences
are known, while the new may be in alliance
with evil powers. This holds true in all
cases obsessed by the impulse of self-preservation
and the fear instinct. What the patients have tried
several times and what has proved good and pleasant
is demanded by the patient to be repeated; the new
is not known and may be risky, dangerous. I have
great difficulty in making changes in the life of advanced
psychopathic cases, because of the fear of the
new, <em>neophobia</em>. Once the change is made, and the
patient becomes adapted to the new way, then the
old way is shunned. In short, <em>neophobia is an essential
trait of psychopathic patients</em>.</p>

<p>The physician must take this trait of neophobia
into account, and as the patient begins to improve,
he must gradually and slowly wean the patient of
this phobia, inherent in the very nature of the
malady. The patient must learn to do <em>new</em> things,
and not simply follow mechanically a régime, laid
out by the physician.</p>

<p><em>The patient’s life must become personal.</em> The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
patient should be made to change many of his ways,
and above all he should learn to follow reason, rather
than habit and routine. Everything, as much as
possible, should be reasoned out,&mdash;he should be able
to give a rational account of his habits and actions.
Whatever appears to be a matter of routine, irrational
and unaccountable habit, simply a matter of
recurrence, of repetition of action, should be discarded,
should be changed to actions and adaptations
for which the patient could give a rational account.</p>

<p>We must remember that the patient lives in the
condition of recurrent mental states, that his mental
activity, as I have pointed out, follows the laws of
recurrence, characteristic of the type of recurrent
moment consciousness.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It is, therefore, the physician’s
object to lift the patient out of this low form
of mental activity to the higher types of rational,
personal life in which the patient can rise above the
perturbations of life, above the pettiness of existence
with its worries and fears. This procedure is
essential.</p>

<p>We can realize how pernicious are those schemes
which physicians and many people in sanitariums
lay out for the patients just to keep them busy for
the time of their stay under special care. As soon
as the patients leave, they are in the same predicament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
as before. The patients wish to have their
lives conducted in the same mechanical, automatic
routine. In this way they are really on the same low
plane of mental life, on the plane of recurrent moment
consciousness, a type which forms the pathological
web and woof of the patient’s life.</p>

<p>Unless the patient is lifted out of this low, mean,
and animal form of conscious activity, he cannot be
regarded as cured. Instead of having the patient’s
life saturated and controlled by the recurrent automatisms
of the fear instinct, he should learn to be
controlled by the light of reason. “A free man is
he,” says Spinoza, “who lives under the guidance of
reason, who is not led by fear.” Epicurus and the
ancient Epicureans laid special stress on the necessity
of getting rid of fear through reason, enlightenment,
and education. Thus the great poet Lucretius:</p>

<p>“The whole of life is a struggle in the dark. For
even as children are flurried and dread all things in
the thick darkness, thus we in the daylight fear
things not a whit more to be dreaded than those
which the children shudder at in the dark and fancy
future evils. This terror, therefore, and darkness
of mind must be dispelled not by the rays of the sun
and glittering shafts of day, but by knowledge of
the aspect and law of nature.”</p>

<p>As Carlyle tersely puts it: “The first duty of a
man is still that of <em>subduing Fear</em>. We must get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
rid of Fear; we cannot act at all till then. A man’s
acts are slavish, not true but specious (we may add
psychopathic); his very thoughts are false, he thinks
too as a slave and coward, till he has got Fear under
feet.... Now and always, the completeness of
his victory over Fear will determine how much of a
man he is.”</p>

<p>The patient complains of lack of confidence. This
is a pathognomonic symptom of psychopathic states.
At the same time there is confidence in the symptom
complex which is often described by him with microscopic
minuteness. The patient has no doubt
about that. He is in search of some one who
can overcome this symptom complex in a way
which he specially approves. The patient matches
his morbid self-will against the physician’s control.
The physician is not to be subdued by the authority
of the diseased personality, he should not let himself
be controlled by the ruling symptoms of the patient’s
life. Either the physician meets with <em>opposition</em>, and
after some time, must give up the treatment of the
case, or he is victimized by the patient’s demands,
and must comply with them. In the latter case the
patient may stick to the physician for some time.
In both cases the patient is not really cured. It
is only when the <em>diseased self</em> becomes subdued
and falls under the physician’s control, it is only
then that a cure is really possible, it is only then that
the normal healthy self may come to the foreground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span></p>

<p>The first and foremost characteristic of psychopathic
states is the narrowing down of the patient’s
life interests. He begins to lose interest in abstract
problems, then in that of his own profession or occupation,
then he loses interest in the welfare
of his party or his country, and finally, in his
family, wife, and children. Even in the case of love,
the psychopathic patient seeks to utilize the person
he loves for his own, neurotic benefit, namely, his
neurotic comfort and health. He loves the person
as a glutton likes his meal, or as a drunkard his
liquor. The self becomes narrowed down to health,
the key to his supposed spiritual life. Self-preservation
and fear permeate the patient’s life.</p>

<p>We notice that the patient’s life activity, especially
his mental functions, becomes narrowed down.
His attention becomes circumscribed to a few subjects
and objects. This is the limitation of the
<em>extent</em> of attention. There is afterward a limitation
of the <em>temporal span</em> of attention. The patient cannot
keep his attention on any subject for any length
of time. This span of attention becomes more and
more limited with the growth and severity of the
psychopathic malady. If the patient is educated and
has had an interest in various subjects, the latter
become more and more limited in scope. Finally
the patient becomes reduced to the least amount of
effort of the attention, and that only for a brief
period of time. When the trouble reaches its climax,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
the patient loses all interest and capacity of reading
and of studying. He cannot think, he becomes
less and less original in his thoughts, he becomes even
incapable of thinking. The patient’s whole mind
becomes limited to himself and to the symptoms of
his disease.</p>

<p>Along with it the fear instinct grows in power,
inhibiting all other activities. There is a limitation
of the patient’s personal self. The personality becomes
reduced to the lowest levels of existence, caring
for his own selfish pains and small pleasures,
which are exaggerated and magnified to an extraordinary
degree. In other words, the <em>personal</em> life of
the patient becomes more and more limited as the
pathological process goes on. It becomes harder and
harder for the patient to take an active interest in
life.</p>

<p>It is clear that under such conditions the tendency
of the patient is to rest and brood about himself,
and keep indulging his limited interests, which get
still more narrowed as the pathological process becomes
more extensive and intensive. Under such
conditions it is suicidal to indulge the patient and
suggest to him a <em>rest cure</em>, a cure which lies along
the line of the disease process, thus tending to intensify
the disease. What the patient needs is to
change his environment, and be put under conditions
in which his interests of life can be aroused.
His life activities should be stimulated to functioning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
on the right lines, laid out by physicians who
understand the patient’s condition. <em>Rest is harmful
to the neurotic. What the patient needs is work,
work, and work.</em></p>

<p>What we must remember in the treatment of
psychopathic patients is the fact that we deal here
with the aberrations of the impulse of self-preservation,
the most powerful, the most fundamental, and
the least controllable of animal impulses, accompanied
with the fear instinct, which is the most primitive
of all animal instincts. This morbid state of
the impulse of self-preservation must be fully realized
before any treatment is begun. The physician
must also see and study closely the line on which the
self-preservation impulse is tending, and comprehend
the associations along which the impulse takes
its course in the history of the patient and in the
symptom complex.</p>

<p>What one must especially look after is the elusive
feeling of self-pity which manifests itself under
various garbs, and hides itself under all kinds of
forms. As long as the patient is introspective and
has the emotional side of self-pity present, so long is
his condition psychopathic.</p>

<p>The extreme selfishness and the uniqueness with
which psychopathic patients regard their own condition
should be eradicated from their mind. It must
be impressed on them that their case is quite common,
and that there is nothing exceptional about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
them. It must be made clear to them that the whole
trouble is a matter of mal-adjustment, that they
have developed inordinately the impulse of self-preservation
and the fear instinct until their mental life
has become morbid and twisted. The whole personality
has to be readjusted. It is the special tendency
of psychopathic patients to regard themselves as
unique, privileged above all other patients, they are
a kind of geniuses among the afflicted, possibly on
account of the special endowments possessed by
them, gifts of quite exceptional and mysterious a
character. “Have you ever met with a case like
mine?” is the stereotyped phrase of the psychopathic,
neurotic patient. As long as the patient
entertains that conception of <em>nobility</em>, the impulse
of self must still be regarded as morbid.</p>

<p>The neurotic must be made to understand clearly
that there is no aristocracy in disease, and that there
is no nobility of the specially elect in the world of
morbid affections, any more than there is in the
domain of physical maladies.</p>

<p>The egocentric character of the psychopathic
patient puts him in the position of the savage who
takes an animistic, a personal view of the world and
of the objects that surround him. Natural forces
are regarded as dealing with man and his fate,
often conspiring against man. Magic is the
remedy by which the savage tries to defend himself,
and even to control the inimical or friendly natural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
forces or objects, animate and inanimate, with which
he comes in contact. This same attitude, animistic
and personal, of the primitive man is present in the
psychopathic patient. The patient is afraid that
something fearful may happen to him. Against such
accidents he takes measures often of a defensive
character which differ but little from the magic of
the savage and the barbarian. That is why these
patients are the victims of all kinds of fakes, schemes,
panaceas of the wildest type, unscrupulous patent
medicines, absurd régimes, mental and religious,
whose silliness and absurdity are patent to the unprejudiced
observer. The mental state of the psychopathic
or neurotic patient is that of the savage
with his anthropomorphic view of nature, with his
fears based on the impulse of self-preservation. <em>The
psychopathic patient is in a state of primitive fear
and of savage credulity with its faith in magic.</em></p>

<p>The emotional side of the impulse of self-preservation
and of the fear instinct should always be kept
in mind by the physician who undertakes the treatment
of psychopathic cases. The physician must
remember that the emotions in such cases are essentially
of the instinctive type, that they therefore lie
beyond the ken of the patient’s immediate control
and action of the personal will. The physician should
not, therefore, be impatient, but while protecting the
invalid against the fears that assail the latter, he
should gradually and slowly undermine the violence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
of the impulse of self-preservation and the anxiety
of the fear instinct. For in all psychopathic maladies
the main factors are the impulse of self-preservation
and the fear instinct.</p>

<br />
REGAINED ENERGY AND MENTAL HEALTH</h2>


<p>The <em>principle of reserve energy</em>, developed independently
by Professor James and myself, is of the
utmost importance to abnormal psychology. The
principle is based on a broad generalization of facts&mdash;psychological,
physiological and biological&mdash;namely,
that far less energy is utilized by the individual
than there is actually at his disposal. A
comparatively small fraction of the total amount of
energy, possessed by the organism, is used in its
relation with the ordinary stimuli of its environment.</p>

<p>The energy in use may be regarded as <em>kinetic or
circulating energy</em>, while the energy stored away is
<em>reserve energy</em>. There must always be a supply
of reserve energy requisite for unusual reactions in
emergency cases. Those organisms survive which
have the greatest amount of reserve energy, just as
those countries are strong and victorious which
possess the largest amount of reserve capital to draw
upon in critical periods.</p>

<p>As life becomes more complex, inhibitions increase;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
the thresholds of stimulations of a complex system
rise in proportion to its complexity. With the rise
of evolution there is a tendency to increase of inhibitions,
with a consequent lock-up of energy which
becomes <em>reserve</em>. Now there are occasions in the life
of the individual, under the influence of training and
emotional trauma, when the inhibitions become unusually
intense, tending to smother the personality,
which becomes weakened, impoverished in its reactions,
and is unable to respond freely to the stimuli
of its environment. The inhibited system becomes
inactive and may be regarded as <em>dissociated</em> from the
cycle of life.</p>

<p>In case of an emotional trauma there is often a
breach in the continuity of association. The affected
system becomes dissociated from the rest of the personality,
and is like a splinter in the flesh of the individuality.
Its own threshold, when tapped, may
be very low, but it is not directly accessible through
the mediacy of other systems; hence its threshold
appears unusually or pathologically high. When
the inhibitions are very high they must be removed.
This removal of inhibitions brings about an access
to the accumulated energy of the inhibited systems.
In case of disjunction or break of continuity we
must stimulate the dormant reserve energy of the
systems, and thus assist the process of repair and
bridge the breach of associative continuity. A new,
fresh, active life opens to the patient. He becomes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
a “reformed” personality, free and cheerful, with an
overflow of energy.</p>

<p>The hypnoidal state is essentially a rest-state
characterized by anabolic activity. There is a restitution
of spent energy; inhibitions become removed,
and access is gained to “dormant” systems or complexes.
The awakened “dormant” complex systems
bring with them a new feeling-tone, a fresh emotional
energy resulting in an almost complete transformation
of personality.</p>

<p>As an illustration of the transformation effected
I take at random the following extracts from some
of the letters written to me by patients who have
experienced this welling up of reserve energy: “Indeed,
were I to fill this entire sheet with expressions
of the gratitude which wells up from my inmost
heart it would be only a beginning of what I feel.
Surely the darkness of the world has been dispelled
since this <em>new light</em> has illuminated my soul, and
<em>I feel that this wondrous light will never fail me</em>. It
were vain to attempt to thank you for this wonderful
transformation.”</p>

<p>A letter from a patient reads: “You will be glad
to know that all is well with me. Life is one happy
day. I am a marvel to my friends in the way of
happiness and cheer. I have to confess that I feel
almost wicked to be so happy.”</p>

<p>Another letter runs as follows: “Next to the gladness
in my own restoration, I am rejoiced at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
wonderful transformation that has come to my dear
friend T&mdash;&mdash; from your treatment. She writes me
most enthusiastically of her steady and sure progress
toward the goal of perfect health, of her
strength to take up the home duties which had been
so burdensome, and she now finds a delight in the
doing of them, and of her husband’s and friends’ joy
in the transformation that has been wrought in her.”</p>

<p>A patient writes: “Your treatments cut a deep
channel in my subconscious life, one from which if
I do happen to wander astray is for only a short
time; then I am carried right back in the trend. In
fact, there exists a deep indelible, happy and cheerful
impression incorporated in my subconscious life
that it is impossible to eradicate.... You have
laid a concrete foundation upon which I am building,
little by little, a structure that some day you will
be proud of, and for which words are insufficient to
express my profound gratitude.”</p>

<p>Another patient writes: “The big result of your
treatment was restoring my faith and arousing my
ambitions. I never think of suicide. I only want
to live and work and redeem myself. I have never
been so happy and I have never worked harder....
I feel the most extraordinary eagerness; a strange,
irrepressible enthusiasm; and an absolute conviction
of the truth and beauty of work, of my work.
I dare not think of failure, and yet success as I
conceive it is too wonderful ever to come. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>
brave will of life in me permitting, I shall some day
approximate my prayer, my dream, my vision; and
then I must let the earth know you are responsible.”</p>

<p>The following extract of a letter, written to me
by a patient, an experienced English surgeon, now
in charge of a hospital in England, whose case was
severe and chronic, dating from early childhood, is
valuable, both on account of his medical training
and his mental abilities which make him an excellent
judge as to the fundamental change and cure
effected:</p>

<p>“It is now exactly two years since I was undergoing
treatment at your kindly and sympathetic
hands. I remember that you once told me that the
seed sown by you would probably take this length of
time to come to fruition. Therefore, it may not be
without interest to you to receive a supplement to
many other letters in which I will endeavor to summarize
my progress&mdash;for the last time.</p>

<p>“I have no longer even the least lingering doubt
that you can count me among your most brilliantly
successful cures. I say this after many&mdash;too many&mdash;heart
searchings which are probably characteristic
of my somewhat doubting temperament. At first, I
was disappointed with the whole business: I suppose
I looked for strange and dramatic events to occur
which would change my whole personality and temperament
in a short time. Nothing so exciting happened;
I left Portsmouth still feeling that I owned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
the same name, and very much the same ‘ego’ that
I arrived with. I was unaware that any profound
psychological operation had taken place. To be
candid, I did not think it had&mdash;the beginnings, no
doubt, were there&mdash;but no more. But now when I
carry my mind back to the type of obsession which
used to assail me&mdash;is there any change? Good God!
I behold a miracle, although it has come about so
silently that I can only realize the difference by comparing
the present with the past. In conclusion I
can only send you my undying gratitude....
You have saved me from what, I honestly believe,
would have one day resulted in deliberate suicide
which I often contemplated as the one solution of
my trouble....”</p>

<p>These extracts are typical of many others, and
clearly show the enjoyment of new strength and
powers until now unknown to the patient. Fresh
reservoirs of reserve energy have been tapped and
have become available in an hour of dire need. The
patient has light and strength where there were darkness
and depression. We are confronted here with
the <em>important phenomenon of liberation of dormant
reserve energy</em>. The patient feels the flood of fresh
energies as a “marvelous transformation,” as a “new
light,” as a “new life,” as “a something worth more
than life itself.”</p>

<p>The hypnoidal state helps us to reach the inaccessible
regions of dormant, reserve energy, helps to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
break down inhibitions, to liberate reserve energies
and to repair the breaches or dissociation of mental
life. The painful systems become dissociated, disintegrated
and again transformed, reformed, and reintegrated
into new systems, full of energy and joy
of life.</p>

<p>The banishment of credulity, the cultivation of the
upper, critical consciousness, the rational control of
the subconscious, the moderation of the self-impulse,
the regulation of the fear-instinct, and the access to
the vast <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'stores of subconscous'">stores of subconscious</ins> reserve energy, all go
to the formation of a strong, healthy-minded personality,
free from fear and psychopathic maladies.</p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
